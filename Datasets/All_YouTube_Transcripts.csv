RVnQnCcVtek,Is Qatar 'sportswashing'? | DW News,it's a month until the start of the football World Cup and this year's host is being accused of censoring critical coverage over a million football fans will head to Qatar where gay sex is illegal and migrant workers face inhumane conditions authorities say LGBT plus fans won't be arrested and that they've made changes to labor laws to protect workers but journalists traveling to Qatar are facing major restrictions including a ban on filming inside homes and accommodation for workers they say the rules will make it difficult to report on topics considered sensitive by the government and so why FIFA says rainbow Flags will be allowed in stadiums we can't expect much coverage of what life is really like for LGBT plus people living in Qatar and it will be difficult to investigate human rights abuses which Amnesty International sales are still significant Qatar and FIFA say journalists will be able to report freely but critics accuse them of sports washing,"The transcript discusses the upcoming football World Cup in Qatar, emphasizing concerns about censorship and human rights. It notes that despite claims from authorities that LGBT+ fans will be safe and labor laws have been improved, the restrictions on journalists, such as bans on filming workers' accommodations, obstruct comprehensive reporting. FIFA's allowance of rainbow flags in stadiums contrasts with the difficulties in shedding light on LGBT+ issues and ongoing human rights abuses, as highlighted by Amnesty International. The transcript suggests that such actions by Qatar and FIFA are viewed by critics as efforts at sportswashing.",Sportswashing,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar
AwTaNr5DsfA,Piers Morgan says Qatar sportswashing debate is 'laced with rank hypocrisy' | The News Agents,and business turned to football we're four days away from uh the opening the World Cup um David bediel told us that he's staying home that his version of football is staying home uh Gary lineker said he wouldn't receive Qatari money uh he doesn't like the feel of it I think that the word bedelia's was reprehensible would would you go to Qatar you excited about the games I'm I'm going to catch up I'm doing some punditry for foxford the America England group State because I I my show airs in America in England so why wouldn't I um and also I gotta say I find a lot of this sportswashing debate uh laced with rank hypocrisy I mean in the Alberta column last week in which I went through all the problems that all the countries in the last 32 have and I mean for example eight of the countries in the last 32 that's a quarter of the countries in the World Cup finals uh Outlaw homosexuality you know one in four countries so if you're going to use that as the stick to beat guitar with you have to then beat the other seven countries you don't have a World Cup and if you don't have it in Qatar which is the first Middle Eastern country to have it where do you have the World Cup do you go to Africa where many countries it's illegal to be homosexual do you go there so that rules out that continent uh do you go to America which has rather Draconian laws about abortion which play very badly for example in the UK in other words once you start putting your moral Halo right where does this where does it stop and who is morally clean enough to actually host a world so are we are we the country that illegally invaded Iraq which then started a 20-year reign of terror by ISIS are we morally clean enough to host okay fraught with hypocrisy so um a lot of what about you there is that basically a big what about serious facts well it's a two fingers up to um members of the LGBT community and presumably to the thousands of Migrant laborers that have died in the making of Qatar in the last 10 years or so I mean is that a kind of like Piers Morgan doesn't really care about okay would you ever go to would you ever go to the Middle East I haven't been for a while would you go to the Middle East I would right and end a debate why is that the end of the debate well if you don't agree with what they do don't go there well I don't think that's the same thing is it I mean we're looking it's absolutely the same thing this is what I mean about the hypocrisy it's completely the same thing the news agents this is a global player original podcast [Music],"The transcript covers a debate on the ethical implications of hosting the World Cup in Qatar, with a focus on sportswashing and hypocrisy in moral judgments. Participants discuss criticisms such as Qatar's human rights record, particularly concerning LGBTQ+ rights, and the treatment of migrant workers. One commentator argues against singling out Qatar, pointing out that many other countries participating in the World Cup also have questionable human rights records. They suggest that if moral purity is the criterion for hosting the event, it would be difficult to find any suitable nation. This point is illustrated through examples, questioning America's right to criticize given its own controversial policies and historical actions. The debate highlights the complexity and potentially hypocritical nature of moralizing in international sports in light of geopolitical and cultural differences.",Sportswashing,0,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar
Gczo2oc14oY,The shadow workers of Qatar: Is World Cup host 'sportswashing' its reputation? • FRANCE 24 English,foreign [Music] cat and we're asking tonight is Qatar succeeding in sports washing its image as the clock ticks down on the World Cup kickoff in Doha in just three weeks time now Sports washing of course if you haven't heard the term it happens when an undemocratic or a very autocratic regime uses Sports to enhance its tarnished reputation now Qatar has been at pains to fend off persistent accusations of worker abuse homophobia sexism racism and as if that were enough corruption uh and what what right now is it front and center are these harrowing accounts of exploitation abuse of thousands of mostly South Asian migrant workers foreign workers who sweat in Toil and critics say they're suffering produced all the glittering new stadiums the hotels the roads the airports that are set to welcome and expected 1.2 million visit 1.2 million to a country of only 3 million add to this a damning report this week Human Rights Watch saying qatars police were still jailing harassing and beating members of the LGBT plus Community as recently as last month September accusations that Qatari officials adamantly deny under intense scrutiny Qatari officials insist they've made progress and they're denouncing what they see as a Qatar bashing conspiracy that ignores changing facts on the ground FIFA's president the governing soccer soccer body says quote Qatar is ready he made that declaration this week but it's an assertion that I can assure you might rile many Skeptics among them uh some of my guests tonight I'm joined here in the studio first by Flora Balter welcome thanks for being here Flora you're the co-director of lgbti plus Observatory absolutely part of the genre Foundation um so I take it that you have slightly skeptical view of Qatar that probably going out on a limb there to say that um also joining me uh here in the studio is uh firas El ecchi if I'm getting that right that's correct right you're a journalist Sports commentator with you're a sport and uh should I say lucky you I don't know maybe lucky you you will be and we'll see watching those matches and and also right next to you uh Chloe domot uh a long time journalist in the Middle East North Africa you've done extensive reporting for uh France 24 but more importantly Chloe you have uh just done a documentary back in the spring uh with uh one of your colleagues and uh you didn't just go anywhere you you're reporting uh it's a documentary that will be airing on France 24 this weekend uh the shadow workers of Qatar and it really went into the heart of some of these workers conditions focusing on their plight plight of these workers who came to Qatar presumably for opportunity but often uh came up against unpaged wages extreme work conditions and and far far worse and so Chloe I do want to start with you because we're actually we have a sneak preview of that documentary uh tonight in this debate um and I I just want to sort of show our viewers one particularly I guess uh impactful segment which uh the documentary you went into uh a workers camp and you really got to see uh just how squalid those conditions are so I want our viewers to watch this um and and just remember that this is actually in a camp among some of those 30 000 estimated workers uh that that are have been building the infrastructure for for the World Cup this is the life we are living here in Qatar Doha this place is very dirty smelling the life you are living here is hell I don't want anyone to know that I'm doing this in Qatar publishing negative images of the country is punishable with expulsion these camps are normally off limits to journalists but Ibrahim and his fellow workers are so fed up with their living conditions that they've taken the risk to let us in with a camera workers cleaned up all they could right from the start but they still lack basic necessities this is our conversation so come inside come inside some people sleeping in the night some people sleep down here someone do like this why like this with the company say will provide us bed the company provide us food system there's no canteen no refrigerator there's not even a dedicated cooking area and this is how we cook our food here just trying to survive here this is what we buy now we don't have any place to go and get some food you say this is what we eat the thing God what is happening to us we are tired now we are really tired that's all I can say in addition to their unsanitary living conditions the workers say they haven't been paid for months every day they promised us to give up the salary and not yet keeping the salary yeah it's about a year now not only me but all my friends we try to talk to the company the companies they will take us to police some of us want to go back to their countries some of us want to change companies the company has taken all our passports what should we do here this is slavery this is kind of prison this is a you abusing human rights this is not fair this kind of life is not fair like Abraham over two and a half million foreigners live and work in Qatar Chloe that son that's a very brave migrant worker uh Ibraham and I mean two things sort of strike me a I I am I correct me if I'm wrong I don't think the Qatari government would just welcome you into these camps how did you get those images how hard was it to get into this to this Camp how did you get those so first it was difficult to meet someone like Ibrahim who would agree uh to tell his story and uh to let us into his uh accommodation most of the people we we met in Qatar were scared to to talk they were scared that they would either lose their jobs or have their visas canceled if they said anything they were threatened really uh if they talked to journalists that's that's how they felt they felt that if they spoke negatively uh against Qatar there would be consequences um until we met Ibrahim uh he he was really fed up with his situation uh so he's a Kenyan worker he arrived in Qatar in 2020 right at first he was is working on construction sites he didn't get paid that's what he tells us and then his Qatari employer moved him to another job he then works at a supermarket and he's also not getting paid and so he he's really he's trying to improve his situation but he doesn't know how and so this is why he agrees to to speak with us under the condition that he remains Anonymous which is why his face is blurred and we also changed his name and you know looking at those conditions I mean it's more squalid actually than a lot of the reports would even suggest um you know it it it's hard to believe that people have actually been living in those conditions but my question is we keep hearing the Qatari government telling us that they have been improving uh conditions that they have been hearing the uh the complaints about migrant workers I mean for years now and this you were there just last spring we're not this was an ancient history this was a few months back it's still like that in some cases it is still like that but I think it is also fair to say that uh with the upcoming World Cup Qatar is under the spotlight it's under a lot of pressure uh and it's hearing this criticism so the authorities have started uh an agenda of Reform they have enacted uh uh reforms of the of the labor laws uh they have opened uh labor courts uh where uh migrant workers such as Ibrahim can sue their employers um we were able to visit uh those labor courts now the problem is that labor courts in other words they can seek redress yes yeah um but the the problem is that those laws they now exist on on paper but it's taking a lot of time for them to be implemented uh it's it's not fully implemented and then the labor courts are are taking a very long time to process all of the files they're getting understandably and and Flora Flora Bolter um from the lgbti plus Observatory I saw you nodding uh maybe a little exasperated watching those images what are you thinking um you know when you hear that there's a little bit of lag time there it takes some time to improve conditions giving the the qataris perhaps the benefit of the doubt you know you can't do it overnight absolutely I mean the change does take time that is certain but the the fact that there is also a question of whether or not there is political will to implement the changes in legislation that have happened in with regards to labor laws for lgbti rights it's a bit the same in the because they have issued a number of statements of reassurance saying of course lgbti visitors will be welcome and we are of course they haven't done that yet but they haven't done yes but but there's also this this discrepancy between between what is said and what is actually the situation and all of that and uh fields and for us so you as a journal journalist commentator who will be there watching this um you know you're thinking you're going to be sitting in presumably in a stadium uh thinking will be sort of in the back of your mind or this city was built by someone who doesn't have a fridge I think the image is a lot it's a lot worse on the construction sites that are no longer construction sites so that's where people died and so I think it's it's a much more difficult image but it is my job as a journalist to be there and to assess the situation um I think this is a very complicated subject and the approach cannot be easy um obviously I strongly condemn this and it was horrifying to see the investigations but also there's something I want to voice that's a bit complicated but this is a nation that's that's starting just you know it's a 40 year old nation and as somebody who grew up in both worlds as a North African who migrated to Europe and lived in between I also know how France as a starting nation was you know it's a nation that call colonized the world that committed atrocities around the world and at the time there was no media and there was no one to say you know what we condemned this so uh I would love that we condemned this absolutely I would love that we stand strongly against this but I would love that the right people do that well okay and this is interesting because okay I'm gonna now switch a little bit of Devil's advocacy here yeah and and Chloe there's another segment that we want to show our viewers because you also went to an Enterprise run by also I believe was a migrant worker originally um it was a water treatment facility uh in Doha itself water filters and uh all staffed by mostly I believe South Indian uh migrants uh working there what's interesting is it was really um our viewers will sleep but it was really uh balanced on the one hand yes they had worked in some cases under bad conditions but they also said a few surprising things at least I found surprising I want our viewers to to see this this visit this segment so good morning everyone hope this month goes very nicely very peaceful very happy okay and lots of business last month you all did very good business I'm very happy it's very nice okay continue with this month farzana starts at 22 years ago as a saleswoman today she manages 14 people all of them come from the Indian subcontinent and are making on average 10 times the salary they would get in their home country but they have to earn their place in the team rajan's Target for this month 15 000 is too less musni for you Adnan also for you 15 000 is too less ask if okay because he's just come from vacation 20. huh these 22 25 22 okay I love it and this is my like I said this is my bread and butter this is my everything my house my office everything is here in Doha of course has given me everything every month fazana receives a dozen CVS from new immigrant candidates for these Indians Qatar represents a kind of El Dorado and because I've just been place and have a more opportunities in India no opportunity to add more money also no experience that's the reason for all people from okay everyone y'all can go to your work thank you very much people die to come here you know anywhere like if you say abroad they're dying to come here they feel that this is there is a tree of cold here they'll come here and it'll be easy but it's not easy because success you have to have sweat and blood yeah in Doha success comes at a price the law requires farzana to be sponsored by a Qatari the system that keeps foreigners under such a guardianship is called la cafala if I'm not a Cutlery like I'm an expat from India I want to start a business here I have to take a sponsor which will be 51 he'll have ownership over the company and do they also take 51 of the profits no no no they don't take that they don't so what do they think they take like I said a monthly um uh this thing like we fix a monthly amount of how much they want monthly you have to accept some things you know you have to bend and twist everything the way you want it to happen because it's business you have to be flexible so I can't be hard and fast about anything because this is their country finally [Music] a real flip side to this story here Chloe I mean part of you thought I'm watching is this some government promotional video is this some sort of no journalistic dog and pony it's not fair grateful to Qatar they're they're actually expressing did that surprise you to find in a way but I mean also you know Qatar is a country where 90 of the population uh is is composed of foreign workers not all of them live in terrible conditions uh for a lot of people uh you know Qatar is a place where they come to find a better life and in some cases they do find a better life right uh this is what happened for farzana she she left India looking for uh opportunities uh looking for a way to be successful and she was able to build a company in Qatar she has employees she she is she's happy story I guess yeah but she has boundaries that she has to respect she has to have uh she needs a sponsor a guitar sponsor that has 51 uh you're Dismantling in that system though right the Catholic system they're gonna yeah gradually um but in her case she still needs to have a sponsor there is a little bit of a racist system there where it does doesn't exist for a strong passport holder by that I mean westerners Canadians Americans but for these Europeans don't need but Indians North no not North Bengali is Nepal exactly they need they do need that yeah Chloe unfortunately you have to leave us you have other pressing engagements but but listen our viewers if you were in intrigued enticed by what you saw there uh Chloe's documentary uh it's uh the shadow workers of Qatar and it is going to be airing this weekend on France 24 uh 35 minutes so a lot more uh you just saw a sneak preview there you'll get a lot more this weekend and uh and a lot of it is really fascinating thanks a lot Chloe thank you very much for being here and I I want to play off of you I wanna I wanna ask you here floor this uh these grateful workers you know this is really the the flip side of the story I guess this would be a great sort of for the the Qatari government Spin Doctors something to put forward what do you think when you hear that they're saying the El Dorado sort of Qatar opportunity land of opportunity it's it's always a message that is being and that is being actively encouraged toward workers all over not all over the world because as you said there is quite a difference between the way they they promote the Qatari system to workers in in in the western world and in in the rest and Global South but um it there are bound to be good examples as well in every situation that's how systems like that survive and we know that they're worth as you said there were so many deaths there were thousands of deaths exactly and and there is and reparations have still not been taken into consideration there is no the identities yes the idea is yes absolutely the idea that that there should be some form of compensation that there should be an effort that you know the the when I was talking earlier about the uh about the the the the message that is being sent and the Declarations that are being that are being uttered there that's something that's quite different from the reality uh on this real disconnect and and there's a and there's a huge so obviously there are going to be examples good examples of your points um I want to ask you about the the numbers of people who they say have died on these sites but first I do want to bring in we have a another guest joining us uh via Skype uh from uh Qatar Victor uh bolo ronduro um if you could hear me I hope I got your name right I I suspect I mispronounced it but uh welcome uh Victor you have hello I see you I can hear you all's good you have lived in Qatar since 2010 uh you're originally from Nigeria and you are right now um you're a sports reporter you work for the uh the peninsula Qatar did I get the name of your paper right yeah right here yeah let me ask you I'm not sure how much you were able to see uh of the previous report from one of our correspondents showing the squalid just as of last spring awful conditions in these workers migrant camps uh yes some grateful workers at a company saying that Qatar brought them a lot of opportunity but a lot of what we're seeing still is more negative than positive that guitar is still not really we haven't seen on on the ground what Qatar has promised and pledged at least on paper um what do you think are they just behind are they acting in good faith will we see those improvements to come will they ever come when okay thank you so much um um let me start by saying um over the years the narrative from the Western media hasn't changed since Qatar hosted I mean be dead and won the the hosting right for the World Cup all over again oh my grant workers this and that and things like that let me start from from the clip that was shown earlier now if you look at the building you it was shown is called environment it borders on hygiene all right what would expect personally everybody living in a house to take responsibility for the maintenance and the hygiene condition of the house you wouldn't expect a Qatari official or someone to help you clean your house to help you maintain how it is to help you dispose off your waste beans and things like that but Victor in this clip also you're watching it they didn't have a bed one of them was sleeping on the floor and there was no canteen they'd had no immediate source of being able to go get food it wasn't simply a matter of house cleaning now it's not sweet I'm not in Qatari I'm I'm an expert here as well so I understand what you are saying but I I doubt very much that's narrative now let me give you you doubt The Narrative so in other words you don't think that report is credible you don't think it's credible well I I I mean very fine I mean the veracity of the report is still under doubt let me jump in here let me jump in here I'm not doubting The credibility of the of the reporters I mean all the key I would be the the those who are the documentary but if you look at it over the years when every time why is it that every time the World Cup is taken out of Europe there is always this negative narrative I will take you back to 2010 in South Africa it was as if the World Cup in South Africa will collapse nothing will be successful the The Narrative right from the the one was all hate crime rate things like that it was as if the South African World Cup will not succeed it was as if everything South Africa would not be able to host a successful World Cup but what happens at the end of the day everybody came they saw and they left happy now look at it we had 24 days to the World Cup I I would expect by now the the narratives and the discussion around the world cup should be about the players the tournament and how Qatar is going to post a very successful World Cup now tell me is there anything different from what's been shown in the clips or what what is being said now that has not been said over the years again now we will talk about you may mention of the fact that Qatar is a 40 year old country which means you accept the reason responsibility that is still a growing country and there are lots of opportunities for correction for growth and things like that which is okay Victor Victor I I take your point I take your point with this narrative and I want to put that question uh to firasa leche here uh for us you know if someone who knows Qatar uh well um do you think the West is over milking this narrative do you think are we making too much of it is it this obsession with you know anyone who's not Western who has a human rights violation you harp on it and you don't recognize the progress of the reality is it's only about that we be talking about the sports I don't know what we should be talking about but I know that certain Western countries are in no position to lecture Qatar about human rights that I know for sure including France because when you look at the I mean what are we talking about here corrupt money France has so much of it when you let so much money infiltrates when you when you have a shady meeting I'm talking about President Sarkozy at the time and the representative of wefa platini they both sat with a ruler of Qatar in 2010 nine days before the voting for Qatar and then you make so many deals out of the sudden you know they're being launching they're buying of PSG weapons you're selling Qatar weapons and then you're lecturing them about human rights and then when it comes to the workers it's not just the stadiums that they built these conditions exist also in the gas pumping industry a gas that France uses so I think when it comes to you know lecturing one second please when it comes to lecturing Qatar don't take their money entrance here and when it comes to migrant rights I think France has a lot of work to do here because when you look at the conditions uh that high qualified North Africans and high qualified sub-Saharan Africans are going through here in France doctors are being are being paid the minimum wage qualified doctors so I think France when it comes to Qatar they have so much money down their throat that we can't hear them talking about him so I want to get to that point Victor I want to give you a chance to reply to that I want to give you a chance to reply I just want to note also today not just France the Australian football team today also uh you know came out with a video of its players uh condemning Qatar for what it sees as a very very uh poor lousy human rights record Qatar hitting back at those allegations uh essentially saying qatar's message Nobody's Perfect it's that it takes time no one's perfect but the Australian footballers too so it's not just France it's not just Europe This is sort of a phenomenon a lot of teams have come down hard on Qatar uh um yeah was George Floyd in the U.S what was that and took him back when you say my grant workers um I take exception to that uh to that thing what do you call an Albania or in someone from Hungary who goes to UK to pick apples or to France or to spend do you pump them on migrant workers why is it that when it comes to issue of Qatar and the Gulf region the time migrant workers are generally used and used and used again I'm talking down about the human rights issues Victor I understand I understand this not just one minute let me just let me answer this now the workers that comes to Qatar your body comes down to force people from their towns from their cities from there wherever jobs are advertised people who apply for the jobs on the basis of their skills on their on the basis of what they have and what they offer and they are they are not brought they have they have life and they are coming and they come in into Qatar to work but they don't come to die they don't come to die this is the point they didn't sign up for that they didn't sign up for these 60 degrees let me ask you that because yeah right the conditions in this but oh boy that's right I just want to ask I don't say the conditions the the weather condition yeah the weather conditions it's 45 degrees to 50 degrees and they're working endless hours in different weather conditions of the locals and there is a different weather conditions for the expatriots let me I wanna I wanna turn to to another guest floor here I want to ask isn't it a you know this nobody's perfect argument isn't it a matter of degree uh and and is there a false equivalency in comparing the West with right now some of qatars for me that question is not relevant because yes of course what about ism is very common today and of course countries are going to criticize other countries and that's fair and certainly human rights are not protected as they should in any country of the world so no country is perfect but I'm not a country I am a person who is who is interested in human rights and I'm trying to promote human rights and the scrutiny I have I wish other people could have this scrutiny on the ground in the country but there is a ban on unions and it's very difficult to raise voices from there we're working with the with the observatory with the Arab Network for human rights and it's extremely difficult for them to be heard and that's also why they need other people to also tell people about what is going on in that country and the human rights violations there are not excused in any way shape or form or whatever human rights violations have happened in other countries in the past and this is not a question of of countries of of judging countries against one another that's what about the argument let me just ask you this human rights report uh Human Rights Watch I'm sorry yes in recent days came out with a new damning report I think we could even show our viewers a quote from it in which it essentially uh you know uh accuses the the preventive Security Police I believe they're called of as recently as La as September it was between 2019 2022 of continuing uh to uh to to beat and harass six LGBT qataris say they were verbally harassed and subjected uh uh detainees to physical abuse ranging from uh slapping to kicking and punching until they bled bleeding one woman said she lost Consciousness security officials also inflicted verbal abuse extracted forced confessions and uh and denied detaine's access to legal counsel family uh and medical care now this is in a cut this wasn't two or three years ago or four years ago this is now amid the tide of allegations when you see that now Qatar says that those are groundless false Human Rights Watch is getting bad information and it's biased and it's misrepresenting Qatar how do you respond to that well well Human Rights Watch is not the only organization uh reporting these cases Amnesty International has also been able to to be in contact with a a number of of Defenders of of lgbti Rights in Qatar and they confirm what Human Rights Watch has been saying and I tend to believe Human Rights Watch which has no interest in particular in defending or not defending guitar you see them as a neutral human rights organization just trying to gather facts in as much as anything can be declared neutral I don't think they have skin in the game as as one could say um but certainly uh I we can the those allegations are also confirmed by the fact that Peter tatchel yesterday campaign absolutely a very famous British uh rights campaigner who went to Qatar to hold up a sign saying that the police I think we have a picture of it in fact yeah yes that there was brutal repression of LGBT persons in Qatar which also includes forced conversion therapy so-called conversion therapy which is another another issue that's quite worrying um but in any case he has been just holding up a sign and has been arrested he was arrested he was arrested no he was he was freed after a number of hours it was unclear for a while where he was or what was happening I believe he was in front of the national museum one of the ones yes in a tourist area and in a very in a very famous place but so he was arrested and they're saying oh nothing bad happened to him but this is already a sign that what he was doing is not it it cannot be considered if if Qatar was so certain of its value as as an open Society or as a as a free state he would not be afraid of protesters such as they would not feel the need to arrest such a person and it is very worrying because of course they keep saying that LGBT visitors will be allowed to do whatever they please or not exactly that but that is very worrying by in terms of the implications of what that says about about local people let me ask you this put it the other way um and maybe I'll provoke you a little bit tug on your your emotional strings here um James cleverly who is the new British foreign minister yes you know where I'm going with this he made some remarks which to put it mildly provoke a little bit of an outcry this week when he basically asks asked told gay fans who are going to attend these World Cup matches in Qatar to respect Qatar to respect their local Customs presumably meaning their local Customs being uh discrimination and criminalization of homosexuality and anyone else who reveals their sexual orientation other than uh the traditional one I want you to hear his remarks I think it's important when you're a visitor to a country that you respect the culture of your host nation we do talk to them about our values and why we believe it's important that people's rights from all kinds of communities are respected and of course it will be something that we continue to talk to them about but ultimately they are very very keen to make sure that football fans have a an enjoyable experience and they have made a a number of compromises to facilitate that uh for us so okay I keep having to play devil's advocate here okay so we are um the West is imposing its cultural values on Qatar you know an age-old you know with its own traditions and our failure to respect those Traditions is also a form of intolerance in a sense is James cleverly does he have a point is he being absolutely absurd is he basically being a spokesperson for the Qatari government um maybe I'm speculating but the the number one country that cut out invests money in in Europe is France 26 billion million euros the number one country in the world is the UK and I think that's enough to get people to say whatever you want them to say that's enough so he's paid I don't know in any form or in any shape but it's we're not we I mean we've we're familiar with the Shady ways of publicity and offshores and real estate and whatever but I'm not gonna get there I'll just say this if you wanna if you wanna host a Universal Event you have to accept the universal values you want to keep your values you want to impose them that's fine don't host a Universal Event where the entire world is invited to come and say you know what yeah not that you know what maybe don't do this maybe don't be that maybe we don't accept this yeah don't have the World Cup then it's easy it's simple Victor polaranduro you heard those those remarks there uh what do you think uh you know you're hosting a global event you have a responsibility the onus is on you the host to adapt to those Universal values not to make the rest of the world adapt to your values well um we've been talking about values it's relative here I must say as don't tremendously in try to abide by the rules and regulations of hosting the World Cup all along the way the questions like these have come up and qatars answered them and responded to them very well they've highlighted and over and over again if I could remember very well they have mirror still repeated the same thing at the United Nations General Assembly that the whole world was welcome to Qatar irrespective of your belief in respective of your valuesive respective of your thoughts and all that and that has never changed from that narrative up until now so I that's I mean the World Cup is 24 days from now and I don't see any reason why um anybody is not welcomed to Qatar but Qatar is open his arms to everything but okay Victor I'm just kidding I just wanna you just saw Peter tatchel he was he was detained and arrested when he tried to put that tolerance to the test now let me let me see every one of his or happily you will expect your believer you expect the belief of orders as well now let me put it this way in the Western World I I I accept everybody irrespective of the belief irrespective of the values they hold but as an African do you believe in polygamy polygamy is a norm in Africa is that valuable expected in the Western World polygamy we're talking about okay as an African money will my marriage still be valued if I marry three wives in Britain for example right well okay listen this is getting there Victor this is slightly a different debate because this is cultural relativism and the question I put to you is about Universal values and universities Universal values being really respect let me ask you this let me ask you this the the head of FIFA okay Gianni Infantino he made some comments the other day and I want our our viewers to hear it and you could you could sort of React to what he had to say it it goes to this point it comes to um to the World Cup well you know we welcome everyone in uh uh Australia New Zealand and we welcome everyone exactly the same in uh Qatar next month I said it I repeat it um we can ensure that everyone is welcome in Qatar we can ensure that whatever nationality background gender sexual orientation everyone is welcoming Qatar Victor quickly I just want to tell you so Qatar as you know it's a mirror it's officials they assure you everyone exactly what we just heard the FIFA president say We'll Be Welcome they say even if they want to wave a rainbow flag in the stadium during the matches they're welcome to do so my question to you is okay The Outsiders are going to be welcome perhaps for a few weeks to do that what happens when they leave well Qatar enshrine this in their law in their codes will they respect these rights afterwards or is this a fleeting thing because they know they have to do this for their Global image for three weeks during the World Cup start with number one I'm not a government official I'm a sports journalist and you mentioned that in the introduction um this kind of questions I mean these questions are questions that are beyond my piglet no but you live there you live there yeah but this is a matter of policy and government policy is it where but how do you feel about it you you clearly must have an opinion would you like to see these rights in shrines in law after the World Cup absolutely the government is trying as much as possible to incorporate everyone okay I have to put that I'm sorry Victor I have to there we are running a limited time I want to put that and ask and ask for us first do you do you think the country government is going to continue this let's just put it quickly in the geopolitical uh scene uh Qatar is doing this to promote its values not to import other values uh Qatar wants to dominate the region it's in pure competition with Saudi Arabia think of it as the Soviet Union United States it's all about ideology and who wins and Qatar is there to enforce its ideology its beliefs its values it's not to do the opposite it's promotion and so they're only literally reacting to this outcry as a sort of exercise and damage control absolutely and would you agree with that wait I'm sorry Victor I want to give Flora uh I would agree with that and what I would also say that if they are willing to have this big event and use FIFA and use international visitors and use different the sports events with with people from all nationalities then it has to accept that there will be scrutiny and that they are held to the standards of human rights as you said if we are willing to go beyond this kind of of what about ISM with countries slinging yeah but you never respected human rights no you started that that doesn't lead anywhere from to end with that we have to have scrutiny we have to have to be informed of what's going on in different countries and we have to increase our our attention to these details I mean FIFA has has adhered to The Guiding principles on business and human rights drafted by the U.N and that is certainly something that's interesting but where does that lead them and what consequences are they signed the charter by the way FIFA did sign in they did pledging to I guess bring some pressure to bear on the host country because try to respect certainly absolutely and if if this is to mean anything it won't mean anything if there is no consequence when when things don't go according to the Charter and I I think it's also important to note especially in the wake of different events that are being attributed to Saudi Arabia or to a number of places that we also need to to bear in mind and to include very much considerations of human rights when we are accepting when we are selecting the candidates for such major events this has to be a Criterion and a central Criterion because we will always have this debate and there will always be human rights violation we need to to put the countries to account for Russia I might give you the the last word here I am once again and I'm going to hate myself for doing this after the show doing The Devil's Advocate thing which is this argument that you know what um hosting this for Qatar it will Foster and lead to reform yes the country might have some autocratic Tendencies it might be slightly undemocratic but it's better to let them host it host it bring the world and it will reform now I mean I I personally was thinking of when I heard that uh Russia did Russia reform after it uh uh you know hosted its own it's its own big sporting event to China when it hosted the cup did it reform after 2008 does this lead to reform no but I believe one of the things it has changed is the very point we started with it really changed the working laws and it's really worked for many uh low-skilled workers it really is changing things when it comes to that and that's the one thing I think we're coming out with in this world cup that that low-skilled migrants in Qatar are benefiting from this benefiting from the spotlight from the debate from the hard talk it's given them a voice and it's echoing and it's working to a certain level and I think after the World Cup that will continue Victor very briefly you're gonna have to find final word one year from now after the World Cup I pick up a newspaper in Qatar and I read the headline uh what is it going to say about the legacy of this World Cup absolutely great it's good the leg is one of the legacies of the World Cup is that normal one is a World Cup for Hall irrespective of every you believe irrespective of your values with respective of your thought and then it's an opportunity now when the Qatar won the beat the question then was if not now then when now if you are talking about one of the legacies is that is going to create an opportunity he's going to develop the sport football in the region now if not now when will the Arab world have the opportunity so the World Cup is coming to the Arab world to help develop football to everything everybody at a whole sense of inclusivity now Victory I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to cut you off there I I take your point uh perhaps an optimistic take on on what the legacy is is going to be here one year down the road I will just note for our viewers I'll challenge our viewers can anyone out there name a Qatari footballer I can I do follow football I can't name a Qatari footballer um it's taking place in the middle of uh of a dead of a desert not exactly uh a a venue or a destination that might automatically come to mind for one of the world's biggest uh sporting events it is down to the wire in Qatar 24 days to go uh Qatar seems to be pulling out all stops in these final weeks to make sure that Sports and politics don't intrude on its big party thanks for watching the France 24 debate thanks to all of you for joining me thank you Victor from uh Doha for uh doing this via Skype I know it's hard I know it's hard when you're not in the studio and you have to you have to try to uh to be heard but uh and thanks to all of you for watching uh the debate here on France flag cat thank you [Music],"The discussion revolves around whether Qatar is successfully engaging in sportswashing by hosting the World Cup, amid allegations of human rights abuses, particularly concerning the treatment of migrant workers and the LGBT community. The discussion outlines persistent accusations against Qatar, including worker abuse, racism, sexism, and homophobia, alongside a recent Human Rights Watch report highlighting the poor treatment of migrant workers and abuse of the LGBT community. Qatar denies these allegations, claiming progress has been made on human rights and labor reforms. Critics, including human rights organizations, argue that despite purported legal reforms, conditions remain dire, with little practical improvement for workers. The discussion also highlights contrasting perspectives, with some migrant workers expressing gratitude for opportunities Qatar offers despite systemic challenges. The conversation touches on whether criticisms are reflective of a Western bias, given historical treatment by Western countries, and whether the scrutiny has potentially propelled some reforms. Skepticism remains about the sincerity and permanence of Qatari reforms, suggesting they might be superficial efforts to improve their global image for the World Cup. The discussion concludes with differing opinions on the potential legacy of the World Cup, with some hopeful that it will lead to sustained improvements in Qatar's labor and human rights practices.",Sportswashing,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar
BlKVfJg4hHE,How FIFA corrupted the World Cup,it's December 2nd 2010 and the International Federation of association football or FIFA gathered in Switzerland to announce which country would host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups and they had assembled a powerful audience here's former U.S President Bill Clinton who was there to back the U.S bid and here's Prince William working on behalf of England's bid behind him is the prime minister of the Netherlands and former Prime Minister of Belgium who together submitted a joint bid but even with all this political power in one room the fate of their countries lay in the hands of these guys the 22 FIFA officials with the power to pick the host they would consider the goals for the bidding Nations they were the masters of their Destiny but many of these men have been accused of abusing their power and this was the moment they took it a step too far 2018 FIFA World Cup ladies and gentlemen will be organized in Russia 22 FIFA World Cup is Qatar decision is still one of the worst decisions made by sporting organization it was catastrophic for feedback they've had their whole legacies called into question the announcement set off at Cascade of events that rocked the world of football and nearly broke FIFA a rampant and deep-rooted Corruption corruption and widespread corruption in the interfering and money laundering how did FIFA go from organizing one of the most beloved sporting events in the world to corrupting it [Music] red in the early 20th century football was already super popular mainly in Europe and South America where national teams had begun playing each other so a group of officials in France formed FIFA in 1904 to oversee these competitions and promote the sport in 1930 inspired by the Olympics they decided to start their own tournament the first question was who would host it out of FIFA's 44 member countries at the time six placed bids to host it FIFA's Congress made up of one representative from each country was put in charge of voting for a winner but really this vote was a facade so there was no bid contests as such it was effectively decided Behind Closed Doors by a bunch of commencing men eventually FIFA awarded Uruguay the rights to host the first World Cup and it was a Fitting Place to do it Uruguay had just won the last two Olympic gold medals in football but it also agreed to pay for a lot including the travel expenses of other teams and share the profits with FIFA in July 1930 13 teams came together to play Uruguay beat Argentina in the finals and FIFA made a solid profit mostly from ticket sales the World Cup was a success over the next couple of decades FIFA decided to rotate the tournament between Europe and South America the World Cup wasn't a grandiose thing back then you know there were some upgrades to the stadiums to the existing infrastructure and a piece of marketing going on but the World Cup wasn't wasn't a truly Global event that all changed when it went on TV I am very pleased that this country is acting as hers for the final of the World Cup once the whole world can watch the tournament the host nation became much more visible leading many more countries to want to host one in virtually every country football has now such a following that no government can afford to ignore it through the 60s and 70s FIFA's membership started exploding by the 80s it had close to 170 members mostly divided into six confederations with their own qualifying tournaments and the organization kept getting richer take a look at how FIFA's profits greased deadly with almost every tournament until Boom the 1980s that's when World Cup sponsorships merchandise and TV rights became worth millions all of this money was largely controlled by 24 officials the leaders of each Confederation and some senior officials like the president this group was called the executive committee or xco they had the power to distribute FIFA's money to its member countries for building football fields holding tournaments and establishing youth programs varial this system about any checks and played lots of money was cycling though you know a development money Kickback became almost standard practice in certain parts of the world FIFA leaders began using Corrupt Practices to gain and retain power the corruption that went on suit to the two presidents avalandra's nakedly corrupt and Arlington bribes that's well documented set glass was very different he was addicted to power there was a cabal of nakedly corrupt committee men within people and Mr blatter ignored their excesses because he relied on their support to keep himself in power it was in this culture of corruption that FIFA in 1964 decided to take the vote away from Congress and give it to exco meaning that to host a World Cup countries only needed to win the votes of a majority of exco just 13 of them the fact that such a small body of and had such a powerful position vested among them without any real checks and balances yeah it absolutely made corrupt sheep part of it FIFA's corruption wasn't a secret but they had moved their headquarters to Switzerland long ago and that meant their finances couldn't really be traced to confirm corruption at least for another decade the 2006 World Cup bid was the most competitive in FIFA's history it had previously begun accepting bids from countries outside of Europe and South America it awarded hosting rights to the U.S in 94 and South Korea and Japan in 2002 for the 2006 World Cup five countries wanted to hosted and for good reason I think there's a huge amount of prestige that it brings to not just the country but the leadership of the country it's sort of a a step on the way towards nation building with more and more countries desperate for World Cup Prestige FIFA found ways to play them off each other the bidding countries spent millions of dollars on a two-year Gauntlet of PR events to impress FIFA and try to outdo each other by promising new stadiums hotels infrastructure and lucrative tv offers this became the well-known public-facing side of the bidding process that was the start I think where the World Cup became really very heavily politicized when the 2006 vote came to a close exco chose foreign thanks to one voter abstaining at the last moment journalists had later revealed that Germany had bribed at least four exco members for their votes including the official who abstained who was the first publicly reported incident that revealed FIFA had another layer to its bidding process that involved cutting deals with XCOM members under the table because of a lack of criteria that governed by the World Cup was going to go the old man who stuck on its executive committee were whined and dined and indulged for a significant period of time and in some cases you know quite handsomely renumerated and it happened again for the 2010 World Cup bid which South Africa won allegations would later emerge that it too had paid ex-co-members for their votes this shadier side of the bid was becoming vital to winning and in the next two bids it would destroy the legacy of the World Cup in the lead-up to this announcement FIFA had decided that the 2018 cup would be in Europe four bidders emerged England with its expansive infrastructure was the heavy favor for the same reasons the US was a favorite among five bidders for 2022. but of course this was only part of what it took to win a World Cup bid the countries that did win the vote that day were the ones who could pour the most money into all levels of FIFA system [Music] people often either look Russian you know Rush is very much at the Forefront of everybody's mind as long as someone like Vladimir Putin were behind it then they were always going to be very competitive in that process this is Bonita merciaris she saw the World Cup bidding process from the inside while working on Australia's bid that same year they had the capacity they had the technical capability they had the facilities Russia pledged to spend 10 billion dollars in the use of 16 stadiums but equally important was the fact that they stacked their bid with Rich influential and well-connected people the head of the Russian bid was Igor chevalov the Russian Sports Minister and the president of the Russian Football Association was also heavily involved and that they brought in some of their oligarchs to help support it financially such as Abramovich what does that tell you it tells you we've got money we've got basically [ __ ] you money we can do what we like and they did ex-co-member Rafael salguero would later admit that he agreed to accept one million dollars for his vote from Russia and Jack Warner allegedly received 5 million for hits Russia was using the full weight of its government corporations and connections to win every layer of the vid process just as FIFA had designed it and they weren't the only ones the reason why I thought Qatar was always a possibility was this wasn't just about the World Cup for them it was the government saying this as an important step in their nation building so they really really wanted it and they had Deep Pockets at first glance qatar's bid was a long shot it's a fairly small country with a football team that's never qualified for the World Cup it was also too hot for football temperatures could reach 50 degrees in the summer and in 2010 Qatar only had one major city and one Stadium big enough for a World Cup game but what Qatar did have is some of the largest natural gas reserves in the world with an enormous amount of wealth all controlled by the country's Amir Hamad bin Khalifa altani and they were willing to use it to win the 2022 bit it pledged to spend an astonishing 200 billion dollars on infrastructure and build 12 brand new air-conditioned stadiums a bid other countries couldn't match and they didn't forget about xco British journalists would later allege that a qatari-owned company paid Warner around 2 million dollars for his vote there's also allegations that Qatar made payments to three other exco members but Russia and guitar's advantages went beyond wealth they were the only two authoritarian countries in the contest meaning they were Freer to work the shadier side of the bid you know the Australian World Cup that was very well funded as well but it was all publicly funded and every every scent was meant to be accounted for you know maybe you could move stuff around spreadsheets and so on but if you're going to engage in the dark arts you had to be very very careful whereas if you were coming from an authoritarian State like Russia or like Qatar you you can do what you like created a bidding process that would inevitably be won by the countries with the most cash and the least accountability and the thing is Russian Qatar got away with it but the scandals that followed nearly destroyed FIFA allegations emerged weeks after the 2010 vote but it wasn't until 2015 that the FBI arrested several FIFA officials in Zurich and launched investigations into Decades of FIFA's dealings even though no one's been put on trial for taking bribes from Qatar since the vote 13 of the 22x co-voters present that year have either been indicted or banned from FIFA at some point amidst these scandals ceplatter resigned in disgrace so in 2016 in an attempt to clean up its act FIFA gave congress the power to vote on World Cup hosts once again but the 2018 World Cup in Russia went on as planned generating record revenue for FIFA and Qatar is predicted to do the same are we comfortable wish the human rights record of Qatar and Russia are they comfortable with what Russia is doing at the moment that decision has been a great enabler for both those countries it's a decision that just doesn't stand the test of time at all they didn't get it right then and it's not right now foreign [Music],"The transcript delivers an in-depth look into

The focus shifts to the internal dynamics of FIFA, detailing the corrupt practices that have plagued the organization for decades. It discusses the concentration of power within the FIFA Executive Committee (ExCo), which had control over the bidding process and finances, often using development funds for kickbacks.",Corruption in Sports Governance,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar
C-0CebFpF_s,How Qatar built stadiums with forced labor,"This is where the FIFA World Cup
final will soon be held... the Lusail Stadium in Qatar. In just four years, it went from this... to this. It has 80,000 seats... and cost more than 
$700 million to build. It's the biggest stadium 
in the Middle East. But it's more than that. Over a decade ago, Qatar had hoped  that hosting a mega sporting event 
in stadiums like these  would put it on the map. But today, stadiums like Lusail
are a symbol of how a country can build 
grand infrastructure to further its own interests and how those ambitions can trap thousands. ""...migrant workers lost their lives
in the construction of the stadiums..."" ""...forced to labor under 
extremely poor conditions..."" ""Migrants working on infrastructure projects 
have died or suffered abuse."" ""The logical source of oil for Europe 
is the Middle East..."" Since the 1940s, when Qatar discovered 
huge reserves of oil and then gas it's been one of the richest countries on Earth. 70% of the government's revenue 
comes from oil and gas exports. Thanks to all that wealth Qatar has gone through a 
remarkable transformation. The capital, Doha, for instance, 
went from fishing town... to world class city in just 
a couple of decades complete with extraordinary museums 
and fancy hotels. But in recent years, the world has been 
turning to renewable energy making the oil and gas market
Qatar relies on even less dependable. And in the Gulf, the country has seen 
regional tensions surge most notably in 2017, when 
neighboring countries issued a blockade against Qatar... cutting off trade and travel. It cost the country hundreds 
of millions of dollars. So to diversify and protect 
its economy... Qatar has started leaning 
into another area that helped establish its status 
as a wealthy nation... sports. That repositioning is 
based on soft power. Qatar is trying to secure friends 
when in need. Particularly powerful friends 
from the West like the United States and the UK. And so the best way to do that is through these soft sectors 
like sports. In the last 18 years, Qatar has held 
more than 20 major sporting events. But nothing compares to 
the 2022 World Cup. ""The winner is... Qatar."" Qatar won the rights to host 
the World Cup in 2010. ""Today we celebrate, but tomorrow...  the work begins."" It had made an unbeatable 
promise to FIFA. It would spend more money than any host had ever done before. $200 billion. And it delivered. Since then, Qatar has 
built up 8 stadiums. It's built dozens of hotels and 
laid down miles of roads and metro lines to connect 
all that infrastructure. They've even completed a whole new city with golf courses, marinas,
and a theme park. It can brag that it is the first 
Middle Eastern country that's ever hosted a mega sporting event. To be able to do that you have a lot of partners, 
including FIFA itself and all the celebrity ambassadors 
who are vouching for Qatar having these incredible world class stadiums, 
these glowing, glistening hotels. You can come to Doha and feel secure that you're experiencing a world 
that's business savvy that's modern and advanced. While the spotlight was 
supposed to show Qatar as a shining example of development... it also exposed one of its darkest secrets. To power decades of development Qatar has relied on a constant supply 
of temporary, low paid workers mainly from South Asia 
and East Africa. Since the early 2000s, so many foreigners 
have come to work in Qatar they now make up 80% 
of the total population. They build, clean, serve, and staff 
pretty much every industry. When we think about how migrant workers 
recruitment journey commences we think about workers who are in extremely low wage situations. So they are looking for a place 
where they can emigrate... to allow them some upward 
socioeconomic mobility. And Qatar promises them that mobility. Typically, Qatari companies hire 
international recruitment agencies that find workers to send over. They promise these workers 
well-paying jobs in exchange for illegal 
recruitment fees upfront. They also have the workers pay 
for medical tests passports, flights, the visa... all to get the job contract. The workers often take out loans 
in their home countries to pay the agencies incurring 
significant debt. It's a huge transnational... cross-border operation... which completely screws workers
at the start of their journey. Workers often use their family's 
savings to pay for a job in one of the richest countries 
per capita in the world. They arrive in Qatar often to find they're not getting the job 
and salary promised and can't do anything about it... because they've now entered 
the country's kafala system. It's a uniquely restrictive 
immigration system that can take different forms 
in different industries. But they all have one crucial thing 
in common. Kafala legally ties the immigrant's 
immigration status to their employer. Meaning an individual employer has to sponsor their worker which gives them an inordinate amount
of power over them. They can control when 
their employees job ends or if they can change jobs. They can control if and when 
migrants leave the country. Often by confiscating their passports. And they can also control the worker's ability to renew their residency and work permit. But beyond the restrictions on a migrant's 
freedom of movement the system also traps them in a cycle of abuse. And that became evident when Qatar
started preparing for the World Cup. To deliver on the infrastructure 
Qatar promised  it tapped into its migrant pipeline and recruited hundreds of thousands 
of new workers. When Qatar was awarded
 the World Cup in 2010... all of the people involved in decision making knew that the World Cup would be built based on the kafala system. Thousands of migrants turned into 
construction workers to build stadiums like Lusail which became the site 
for human rights abuses that ranged from 
verbal abuse to death. Several investigations into Qatar's stadiums revealed that employers
usually house workers in private camps far 
from city centers... where they are forced to live 
in overcrowded rooms and unsanitary conditions. And at work, their lives 
are put at risk. Migrant workers are often given 
the most dangerous jobs on the site and can be forced to work up to 14 hour days in Qatar's extreme heat. The day this photo of the 
Lusail stadium was taken the high in Doha reached 
109 degrees Fahrenheit. They have spent so many hours 
in the blistering sun... and after that they only permitted a five minute break to eat and they eat standing 
and then go back. Whenever you're also up on a scaffolding,
coming down for a bathroom break might get you in trouble with your boss. And so you end up drinking less water despite the need to have it to avoid heat exhaustion. The number of work-related
migrant deaths surrounding stadiums remains unclear due to Qatar's lack of transparency. In fact, that's the case for 
the entire kafala system. But there have been some clues 
along the way. The death certificates Nepal
has received with the bodies sent back from Qatar show that nearly 120 Nepalese migrants  have died on the job since 2008. The real number, though, 
is likely much higher. In 2019, a study examined the link 
 between Nepalese worker deaths and heat exposure and concluded heatstroke was a likely cause of cardiovascular deaths. That alone could raise the number 
of just Nepali migrant worker deaths to about 600. In addition to living and working 
in abusive conditions many are also not getting paid 
for their work. Workers have repeatedly faced wage theft. So then the debt keeps racking up because the debt still exists 
and in many cases workers have still not been able to 
survive on a daily basis. This is one of the richest countries 
in the world and yet they haven't been able to accelerate its reforms and ensuring people 
have been paid on time. Some workers try to file complaints, 
only to find there are few effective mechanisms in place. And speaking out comes with 
risk of retaliation... which has kept migrants isolated
in the kafala system with increasing debt and 
unable to access justice. After years of mounting pressure from human rights organizations 
and a formal complaint that reached the UN's International 
Labor Organization... in 2017, Qatar signed 
an agreement promising to align its laws 
and labor practices to international standards. In 2020, 10 years after construction 
for the World Cup began Qatar implemented a minimum wage 
for workers and now allows them to terminate their employment contract. But... The challenge with the minimum wage 
laws is enforcement. Employers started pushing back 
against the government. And so even though we haven't seen 
amendments to the legislation. Indeed, we're seeing a watering down 
of reforms. And for the migrants who have already 
been abused to the kafala system. This is all too late. Civil rights groups and 
football associations are now calling for a remedy fund to compensate the migrant workers financially. And some teams have 
taken a stand in the field... and on social media. ""We have learned that the decision to host the World Cup in Qatar which resulted in the suffering and harm of countless of 
our fellow workers..."" Making this year's World Cup a particularly difficult one to watch. Millions of football fans will still tune in and cheer 
for their favorite teams. But after that final match is over... and the trophy is awarded... stadiums like Lusail will continue 
to be a grim reminder that it all came at 
a human cost.","The transcript provides an in-depth examination of the controversial aspects of Qatar hosting the FIFA World Cup, highlighting the stark contrast between the country's rapid infrastructural development and the human costs behind it. Qatar utilized its substantial oil and gas wealth to transform itself and gain international recognition, largely through hosting major sports events, a strategy identified as a form of soft power. The construction of facilities like the Lusail Stadium is emblematic of this transformation, but has also drawn attention to severe human rights abuses, especially concerning migrant workers. These workers, who account for a significant majority of Qatar's population, have faced dire conditions under the kafala system, with reports of deaths, poor living conditions, wage theft, and lack of legal protection. Despite Qatar's legislative changes in response to international pressure, the enforcement of these laws is weak. The narrative questions the ethical implications of hosting the World Cup in Qatar, noting that while football fans globally anticipate the event, it cannot be separated from the story of exploitation and unmet reforms. The Lusail Stadium, therefore, stands not only as a marvel of modern architecture but also as a harrowing symbol of the human lives lost and disregarded in the nation's quest for prestige.",Human Rights Issues,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar
ynVikeFUvW8,How Qatar is using secret strategy to rise in POWER : Qatar World cup Case study,[Music] the winner to organize the 222 FIFA World Cup is Qatar to host the cop the tiny Gulf Nation went on a stadium building spree bringing in thousands upon thousands of Migrant laborers the tournament is highly controversial and expensive the costs have already exceeded 200 billion dollars and could go even higher Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates Egypt Bahrain and others have cut diplomatic ties over what they say is qatar's support of terrorist groups they let oppressive regime Source major events they LED dictators organize the Olympics Sports washing makes you forget a country's crime instead you see the wonderful Opening Ceremonies you'll see hundreds of athletes enjoying themselves [Music] hi everybody the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar has been the most Sensational event of the year after the Russian invasion of Ukraine and by now you all must have already heard about the bizarre economics behind this world cup for those who don't know while South Africa spent 3.6 billion dollars into hosting the World Cup Brazil spent 15 billion dollars and Russia spent 11.6 billion dollars but Qatar alone has already spent over 200 billion dollars just into hosting the World Cup now mind you we are talking about a country that is practically a desert but the qadari government has pulled off such a miracle that they built seven new stadiums brand new roads countless hotels a new Metro system and even have air conditioning for the imported grass that they've grown now considering the fact that FIFA is the most Sensational sports event in the world most people would think all this money is worth it and World Cup is an extremely profitable event right well guess what hosting both the World Cup and the Olympics is a complete waste of money because while the host country has to Bear all the expenses of the super expensive infrastructure projects all the significant Revenue through ticketing merchandise and sponsorship actually go to FIFA in fact immediately after the World Cup these stadiums and infra turn into such a wasteful expenditure that this Brazilian World Cup stadium is now being used as a bus depot and in qatar's case Even after spending 200 billion dollars Qatar is only expected to make 15 to 20 billion dollars in return now this begs the question why is Qatar hosting the FIFA World Cup in spite of it being such a ridiculous waste of money what is qatar's hidden geopolitical strategy behind this world cup and most importantly since this is an epitome of propaganda as students of marketing what are the study materials to help you understand the depth of marketing and propaganda better this video is brought to you by idfc First Bank but more on this at the end of the video to understand this deep story we first have to understand the vulnerabilities of Qatar and how much Qatar is integer the first one that Qatar has is the over dependence on oil and gas and if you look at their GDP almost 60 percent of their GDP comes only from oil and gas and considering the Speedy action of the world against climate change if you look at this graph by British Petroleum it says that considering the fact that 4 out of the six biggest oil Buys in the world intend to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. the demand for oil will slow down by 71 meanwhile as you can see from this graph the cost of renewable energy has already started dropping below the fossil fuel cost so Qatar can no longer depend on oil Beyond 2050. this is the first problem that Qatar has the second problem is qatar's location now if you look at the map Qatar is surrounded by Rivals from all directions these countries are Saudi Arabia Egypt UAE and perin and as you can see these are not ordinary Rivals but include two of the most powerful oil countries on the planet which are Saudi and UAE and the only reason why Qatar is surviving until now is because of a security guarantee from the U.S so in the next 30 years when oil and gas are no longer valuable if the U.S withdraws its guarantee it won't take a lot of time for its neighbors to conquer Qatar and qatar's own Army is so small that it has only 22 000 men in fact even for the World Cup they had to import the Pakistani army for help this is the reason why not just Qatar but every other Middle Eastern country is trying to diversify their income so that they can have a source of Revenue and an alternate instrument of Leverage in geopolitics now if you look at other countries they all have some very significant diversification instruments for example for UAE it is a financial and transshipment hub in the form of Dubai and for Saudi it is this critical access to the Red Sea and the Swiss canal and this is extremely important because 30 percent of the entire world's container traffic flows through the sewage Canal so if Saudi wants a source of Revenue they can start charging all the ships and make money out of C toll but if you look at Qatar it is on the other side of the land and it is nowhere close to UA in terms of diversification this is the second problem that Qatar has and this brings us to the last problem of Qatar and that is its Global image now people when I say Dubai you can imagine a magnificent infrastructure there right when I say New York you can imagine the Madison Square Garden right but when I say Qatar what comes to your mind nothing except desert isn't it this is again one of the biggest problems of Qatar which is global perception so to put that straight Qatar is on a clock to solve three major challenges by 2015. number one is economic diversification from oil number two is to keep long-standing security guarantee even after oil gets over and the last challenge is to improve its image in front of foreign investors so the question is how is Qatar trying to fix these problems and what is the connection of these problems of the World Cup well the first part of this answer lies in something called Sports washing to tell you about it Sports washing is a Public Relation strategy that is deployed to clean up the image of a country in the eyes of the international audience in simple words it's nothing but a tool of propaganda and it's not just Qatar the strategy of sports washing has been deployed ever since the times of Hitler the city of Berlin was awarded the auspicious task of hosting the 1936 summer Olympic Games it would be the first time a host nation would project his political ideology and power onto the world the German athletes Were Soldiers on the propaganda battle Berlin is cleaned up anti-jewish signs will remove everything was done to create the impression that this was a hospital climate no one could have predicted was that these games would be used as a tool for some of the slickest propaganda by one of the most tyrannical regimes the world has ever to tell you about it if you remember in 1923 Germany had witnessed one of the most terrible hyperinflations in the world and the condition was so bad that in early 1922 160 German marks was equivalent to one US dollar but by November 1923 the currency had depreciated so much that the same one US dollar was equal to 4.2 trillion German marks 1923 was disastrous for Germany in that year the great German inflation reached its peak for some time the value of the Mark had been dropping and as the value of the notes decreased so the amount of notes needed to buy things grew to beat this crisis and pay the strikers in the Roar the government simply printed more money and as it lost its value so it cost more and more to pay wages to buy food Millions whatever figure was printed on the notes ready meant nothing the German Mark was worthless and this led to severe unemployment starvation and poverty and everybody around the world saw Germany as a failed impoverished Edition but in the next 10 years Germany had made some progress and they wanted to show the world what Germany looked like in the 1930s this was one of the most important reasons why Germany won the bid to host the 1936 Olympics in 1931 but in between Germany was in for a surprise because in 1933 Hitler became the dictator of Germany and the entire world had heard rumors about the racism against Jews in Germany but this is when the propaganda minister of Hitler saw Olympics as the best opportunity to show three things to the world number one they wanted to show what new Germany under Hitler looked like number two they want to prove that dictatorship of Hitler was far better than the democracies in Europe and lastly they wanted to market the idea of the Aryan race to the world and here's the most ironic fact of all Hitler actually released hundreds of pigeon in the ceremony as a message of peace to the world and guess what the 1936 Olympics was the first Olympic event to be broadcasted on television so it was by far the most powerful tool of propaganda on top of that during the games the science of banning Jews from public places had disappeared the Germans were ordered to be very nice to everyone especially African Americans why because back then with the ongoing racism against black athletes in U.S and Europe when these athletes came to Germany they were delighted to see the kind of respect and Hospitality that they got in Germany so when they went back home the stories of equality and hospitality of Germany traveled all across the world in fact one of these black athletes said to the press that Germany treated him so well that he didn't have to sit in the back of the bus similarly many reporters wrote good things about Germany in their newspapers so just like Hitler wanted the people of the world actually saw how much Germany has developed in just 13 years in spite of witnessing the worst economic crisis in its history and this change in perception is what gave Hitler immense power both inside Germany and outside Germany this is how Sports washing works so ever since Hitler did it even other leaders have done it for example Africa is often ported as a backward impoverished and conflict attrition right in fact even if I ask you what Ethiopia looks like the picture in our minds is that of A Primitive Country isn't it but when I say South Africa and Cape Town do you see the same kind of picture no right why because we have seen how beautiful South Africa looks like in our cricket matches we saw the 2007 T20 World Cup hosted in South Africa together and we've also seen Legends like AB de Villiers Dale stain jonty Rose and fav duplessy play cricket in India so we do not have that kind of image about South Africa right that is the power of sports washing in fact this is the reason why South Africa held the FIFA World Cup in 2010. this is what sports washing strategy is deployed for and if you look at Qatar this is exactly what Qatar is doing so just like Germany wanted to show off their new German developments Qatar is hosting the World Cup to show the world that Qatar is not just a desert that found oil but a fully developed and modern country and here's a look at the incredible architecture of Qatar [Music] [Music] and secondly just like Russia wanted to sweep its War progression under the carpet of World Cup publicity in 2018. Qatar wants to sweep its human rights violation homosexual abuses and Military funding like subjects under the carpet or World Cup publicity in 2022 because this is what the Dark Side of Qatar looks like [Music] evidence that Michael's working on infrastructure projects in the final months before the tournament have died or suffered abuse migrant workers who built the massive soccer stadiums endured unsanitary conditions in extreme heat injuries and deaths have been reported now how successful Qatar will be in sportswashing only time will tell and this brings you to the second compelling reason for Qatar hosting the World Cup and that is foreign investments you see guys world cup is one of the many avenues for Qatar to be on the spotlight and invite Global Investments so if you see now that so many Rich investors and bankers see and visit Qatar the World Cup almost serves like an expo to help them see the infrastructure of Qatar in fact this is the reason why Qatar has even found a way to entice his investors through various games such as exemption from income tax for 10 years exemption from import Duty on raw materials and lucrative land allocation projects as a result foreign investment in Qatar is expected to flow faster in the next five years this is how Qatar is using the World Cup to clean up its image and invite new investors now again how far they'll be successful only time will tell and this brings us to the last instrument of qatar's diversification which is something called the Qatar investment Authority this is nothing but a wealth fund that decides where to invest the unlimited cash that qataris have and if you look at their Investments it will blow your mind fun fact to hear is that Qatar owns even more property in the UK than the king of England himself and while UK companies owned 21 of the 15 most expensive skyscrapers in London katahar alone owns 34 of those skyscrapers but that's not all they even bought the Paris saint-german football club in 2011 which then went on to win four French Soccer League titles on top of that Qatar is also an investor in London Heathrow Airport Saint Petersburg airport in Russia the Volkswagen group The Royal Dutch Shell the Bank of America and even the Barclays Bank cherry on the cake they've even invested in Uber and expanded in Silicon Valley and even invested in New York real estate now most people might ask why why is Qatar buying up so much property well I would like to make a separate video on that but long story short when you buy or fund any big leaks when you buy giant properties in one particular country you get access to the most powerful people in that country this includes business magnates common officials and even celebrities so that way you can divert your money to fund a political party influence government policies and eventually profit your economy by billions if not trillions of dollars a classic example of the same is gas prom now the Russian energy charm gas problem gas prom gas prom gas prom are a Russian State Energy company one of the biggest backers of UEFA they've been an official UEFA commercial partner since 2012 and their current deal is worth about 30 million pounds a year to UEFA gasparam is the Russian State gas company and they were one of the biggest sponsors of ufi and many other football events on top of that a Russian oligarch had even bought Chelsea which was by far one of the most valuable clubs in the world so slowly by buying into these big leagues Putin had built such a great relationship within the European Circle that the German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder lobbied for the Russian gas in Germany as a result Germany got dependent on Russian gas and now we all know how that has to turned into a nightmare for Germany friend after leaving office in 2005 refused to distance himself from the Russian leader similarly when Qatar Buys so much property and Qatari billionaires get into the inner circle of the most powerful people in the world they can put their money to good use by tweaking the government policies around the world to favor Qatar this is how through Sports washing through Sports investment by enticing foreign investment and by getting into the most powerful circles in the world the Qatari government is doing everything in its capacity to make a name for itself in the global economy this is the story of Qatar a nation that is struggling to prevent its blessing from turning into a curse and this brings me to the last part of the episode and that are the study materials to help you understand propaganda and geopolitics better moving on there is one Bank in India that is surely going to make a name for itself for the right reasons and that is our partners for today's episode and that is idfc First Bank idfc First Bank is a new age bank that's revolutionizing the way India Banks what I love about them is that they are on a mission to create the world's most customer friendly bank and I generally think that their products and services are designed for that mission where most banks offer interest rates of three to three point five percent per annum idfc First Banks interest rates start at four percent per annum and on balances of rupees 10 lakhs and above you earn 6.25 per annum and if you feel this is extraordinary wait until you hear about their credit cards idfc first credit cards have zero annual charges and zero joining fees but what's more important is that there are no minimum spend conditions whereas most of the banks waive Annual fees sub object to these minimum spend conditions on idfc first bank's credit cards you pay zero interest on ATM cash withdrawal till the due date all you pay is a flat fee of 180 rupees per withdrawal most of the banks charge you interest from the moment you withdraw cash and also charge a fee of 250 rupees per withdrawal and not just that at idfc first bank the credit card reward points never expire and these reward points can be redeemed on any online purchase so these reward points are as good as cash Yes you heard that right now isn't that customer friendly if this sounds useful to you go open an IDC first bank's savings account or get a credit card and get incremental value through their customer friendly products through the link in the description moving on to the study materials the first thing I'm attaching is a book called propaganda by Edward Barnes secondly I am attaching a Johnny Harris episode which will help you understand how Qatar uses money to get into the most powerful circles in the world and thirdly I am attaching a Vox video which will help you understand the conflicts in the Middle East better so do have a look at them and let me know what you think and remember you can either open your IDC First Savings bank account or apply for a credit card and get up to 10x rewards on the money you spend for the things that you love the most the link to apply is in the description so go for it that's all from my chapter today guys if you learned something elbow please make sure to the like button in order to make YouTube Baba happy and for more such insightful business and political case studies please subscribe to our Channel thank you so much for watching I will see you in the next one bye bye [Music],"The transcript outlines Qatar's hosting of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, highlighting it as a prime example of sportswashing. Qatar has invested over $200 billion, significantly more than previous hosts like South Africa, Brazil, and Russia, to construct seven new stadiums, infrastructure, and facilities in a bid to project itself as a developed and modern nation. Despite the event’s immense costs, the expected financial return is minimal, raising questions about the motivations behind such an investment. The transcript delves into Qatar’s overreliance on oil and gas, geopolitical vulnerabilities, and the need to improve its global image and attract foreign investments. It illustrates how hosting the World Cup serves as a mechanism for Qatar to enhance its international perception and diversify economically as oil dependency declines due to climate change actions. The text describes sportswashing as a strategic image-cleaning effort, likening it to practices employed by Nazi Germany during the 1936 Olympics to improve its global standing and mask internal human rights violations. Moreover, the transcript highlights Qatar's investments in global real estate and sports, such as the Qatar Investment Authority’s control of high-profile properties and sports franchises worldwide, to secure political leverage and economic diversification. It concludes by presenting this as an example of soft power and geopolitical strategy to counter Qatar’s regional risks and improve its future stability. The overall tone criticizes the expenditure and intentions behind Qatar's World Cup initiative, highlighting potential human rights abuses and geopolitical maneuvers.",Sportswashing,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar
dt_Q03HNbTk,What Qatar Doesn't Want the World to See | WORLD CUP 2022,"(crowd cheering) - [Announcer] And it's a good shot. - We found something in our reporting, something happening here in
the one big city in Qatar, a place the whole world
is looking at right now, (dramatic music) an invisible border drawn
to trap human beings, to make them work, to make them build. I wanna show this to you. So, let me take you back
to show you how we ended up sending a camera to someone and teaching them how to
shoot undercover in Qatar while simultaneously capturing
interviews in rural Nepal and how I ended up here staring for hours at maps drawn by the Qatari government, all of this to shine a light on something that Qatar doesn't want the world to see. - [Raj] All of these have
been emptied very recently. (fingers tapping) (mouse clicking) - Hey, I need to show you something. I've been looking at maps of Qatar because the World Cup is going there. When the world is gonna
be fixated on one place, you gotta look at all the maps. I've been on the
government website of Qatar looking at their zoning maps. This is the city of Doha,
the capital of Qatar, but look at this. The whole city is yellow, and there's this one little shape of blue, Doha Industrial Area. I know we're talking about zoning. I think something's up here. I've been trying to map this, like, throw it on, like, my
other tools to map it and see if there's,
like, what this could be, and it's not totally making sense. It's kind of cut off from
the rest of the city. There's another municipality
kind of in between it and Doha, but it's a part of Doha. Usually, when you have
weird zoning like this, there's something going on. Since Qatar got awarded
the World Cup in 2010, there's been all sorts of issues with their labor
conditions and all of that, and I think this has to do with that, but I don't totally know. The World Cup is happening in a few weeks. I wanna go to this place. (camera clicking) I need to reach out to Cammy,
one of our research producers. We're gonna dive into this. We're gonna figure it out. We're going to Doha, folks. Hey Cammy, I wanna go to
Qatar before the World Cup to look at this one part of the city that's completely zoned differently. I think it has to do with,
like, the labor situation there. (printer beeping) I can't not print it. (paper rustling) All right, I'm going there. We have to find a fixer, a local producer, someone on the ground who
can help us not get arrested. I will follow up tomorrow
with more details. Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo. - Hey.
- Going to Qatar. ♪ Doong, doong, doong, doong,
doong, doong, doong, doong ♪ - Johnny, yes, let's do it. This sounds like a really great story, and I'll happily go to Doha with you. I'll start researching right now. - I'm going to Qatar. - Congratulations. I just want you to be smart. - I've been doing some
research, and I don't know how easy it's gonna be
for us to film places, especially in the Industrial Area. From what I've read, they're notoriously not very kind to journalists. - The best part about the
Gulf is that these cities are, like, so, like, cartoonish. This is a hotel in freaking Doha. Look at this. Opening later this year. Can I stay in this hotel that looks like a freaking half pipe? I've always wanted to do this. I've never had an excuse. (energetic music) - Doha fixer number one
referred me to someone else, so fingers crossed that Doha fixer number
two is gonna work out. - Drones, yes. Do you think they'll let
me fly my drone in Doha? - No. - [Johnny] Why? - NATO countries are helping
out doing anti-drone stuff 'cause they're afraid of, you know, terrorist drones coming in so that, like- - [Johnny] Wait, but what
about just my DJI drone? - They're sending out anti-drones- - [Johnny] Geez. - to net them.
(camera clicking) - [Johnny] Wait, what? - Yeah, oh, lemme show you. - Okay, not great news, our
fixer hasn't found anybody in the Industrial Area
who wants to talk with us. It's not looking likely that
they're going to find anybody. I'm gonna keep trying to connect
with anyone on the ground. - I think it's a hiding people thing. I don't know, but I'm
trying to find a fixer to help me get in there. - You're gonna go in there? - Yes. I mean it's just, it's not,
like, some secret part- - You're supposed to be leaving in a week, and we haven't found any fixers. We haven't found any people on
the ground who could help us. I'm just a bit concerned
of our timeline right now. (pensive music) - I think we found someone, a fixer who is deeply connected with
the worker population in Doha and is potentially gonna help us to get into the Industrial Area. We're meeting with him on a call in a few minutes.
(app ringing) Here we go. Nice to meet you. How are you doing? - [Fixer] Fine, let's switch off the A/C. - Did you get the proposal that
we sent over of what we're- - [Fixer] Yeah, proposal, I read. - We're not trying to get
any secretive footage. It's more just about life
in the Industrial Area. I guess my question for you is, like, if I went into the Industrial
Area with my camera, not a big crew but just
my camera to go film- - [Fixer] What camera? - Like this. If I went into the Industrial
Area with this camera- - [Fixer] No, no, no. - and filmed
- [Fixer] No. Another thing, your skin color
is also a problem, you know? - Ah, explain that. What do you mean? - [Fixer] Yeah, it will make, you know, you will get undue attention. - From who do you think I
would get undue attention? - [Fixer] You know, of course,
the informers, and you know, these Industrial Area
Asian towns are controlled by internal security
forces, Al-Fazaa police. - So, it's not very smart for me to go filming around in that area? - [Fixer] Yeah. - Okay, and I think that's why
we want to figure out a way. - [Fixer] Have you ever
been to Doha, I mean- - [Johnny] No.
- in Qatar? - It's my first time. (fixer clears throat) What do you think? (dramatic music) - Okay. This is not happening,
this is not happening. If we can't do the shots,
then this story doesn't work, meaning I won't go to Doha. So, it's pretty important
for us to know soon if this is feasible or
if it's not feasible. Iz, can you- - [Fixer] Yeah, yeah, I
understand, I understand. - Well, it's really nice to meet you. Thank you so much for chatting. I can't safely go into
this Industrial Area. Like, it's now clear to me, like, every fixer has just been like, ""No."" This guy just said it point blank. He's like, ""You're a
white dude with a camera. Like, this is not safe."" - It feels like, if you go,
you're just gonna, what, get shots of shiny buildings
and not actually gain access. - Yeah. - Which I guess could be cool. - No. - I mean, there's an option here where you try to find someone that could go in. - And then, if we could
get, like, a camera person in Nepal, or Bangladesh, or somewhere where workers have been and gone home, we could totally tell this story. The World Cup is literally
a few weeks away. I got some work to do. The new plan, find someone
on the ground in Qatar who will go into the Industrial Area
(paper rustling) and tell me why the hell the government is so afraid of me going in with my camera. (paper rustling) (mouse clicking) Okay (sighs). Okay, before we continue, I need to tell you about something, which is that today's video
is not sponsored by any brand. Sometimes we do really deep dives into complicated and sensitive topics. It's hard to find a sponsor
when we make stories like this. I wanna tell you about a way that you can support what we're doing. If you're not interested in
hearing this pitch from me, that's totally fine. So, I'm gonna put a little bar down here on the bottom of the screen. For the rest of you that
are still here, thank you, and I wanna tell you about The Newsroom. The Newsroom is our community on Patreon, which is more and more
turning into a place that I am very excited about. Journalism is changing,
and I'm making big bets that the type of journalism
that will succeed in the future is the type of journalism that dives deep without the need for a journalistic institution to dictate what direction we need to go. I want the story to guide
me whatever way it takes me. And I'm allowed to do that because I'm here on
YouTube with all of you. But doing this form of
journalism on YouTube is incredibly resource intensive. Behind the scenes, we have
a lot of people making sure that we're factually accurate, that we are actually finding
the best facts possible. It's hard and resource intensive, but I'm gonna keep doing it. That's where you all come in. For those who are supporting
over at The Newsroom, you allow us to do this
kind of journalism. But if that's not enough for you, we also have some really cool perks, including an extra video every month. We do a behind-the-scenes
video every month, where we show you everything
that is happening, all of the people, and
personalities, and processes that make this stuff happen. There are a lot of really
fun, talented people making this work possible. You also get access to one
of my scripts every month, and you get access to some
exclusive Tom Fox tracks. Tom is our composer. He makes amazing music. We will give you some of
that music, royalty free, for you to use however you'd like. And we'll ask the community to vote on thumbnails, and
titles, and video ideas. And I really value having a
smaller version of this group here on YouTube but, like,
over on The Newsroom. If you're not able to
support, that's totally fine. I appreciate you being
here in the first place. At the end of the day, being
here, watching the videos, sharing them is a huge way
that this community allows me to do what I can do to
make better journalism. So, that's my little pitch to you for those interested
and willing to support. I want to get back into this story and show you how we ended
up in this situation. (resolute music) Qatar is a tiny, super-rich
country in the desert, and it sits on the largest known
natural gas field on Earth. (liquid sloshing) Since their independence in 1970, Qatar got really rich, really fast, leapfrogging the normal
economic development process that countries go through as they grow. Usually, as a country gets rich, immigrants from poorer
neighboring countries migrate in to take lower paying jobs
(machines buzzing) required to keep the economy growing, construction, hospitality, manual labor, care-taking, food services, you know what I mean. Every rich country experiences this, but in Qatar,
(inquisitive music) all of their neighbors were also getting super rich super fast,
so they started looking elsewhere for cheap
labor, and soon, there was a flow of people taking these jobs. But there's a tension here. Thanks to all this
abundant oil and gas money, the Qatari government provides
a luxurious welfare state to their citizens, free
healthcare, education, guaranteed jobs, subsidized housing, and literally, they just get
paychecks for being Qatari, for winning the fossil-fuel jackpot. So, Qatar needed labor
from other countries, but they didn't wanna let these immigrants in on the sumptuous benefits
of their welfare state. So, they started using this system, where employers could sponsor workers to come to Qatar to work. They wouldn't be citizens
or anything close to it. They would be totally at
the mercy of their employer. This was called the kafala system, and it was the foundation upon which Qatar built its country. (inquisitive music continues) - The winner to organize the 2022 FIFA World Cup is Qatar. (energetic music)
(audience cheering) - So, this is a giant moment. It's oof. I mean, I made a whole video
about how this happened. I'm not gonna go into it, but the fact is that, as soon
as Qatar won the World Cup- - Thank you, FIFA. - they had a lotta work to do because their country didn't
have a lot of infrastructure, basically any infrastructure
at all, to host this thing. So, wait, why were they
chosen to host the World Cup if they didn't have any infrastructure? It's a long story. Again, I made an entire video about it. The fact is they needed to build a bunch of stuff in a very short time. So, what they basically did
is just ramp up the system that they already had,
importing tons of labor from South Asia and Africa
to come build their country, in this case, to build
infrastructure for the World Cup. (energetic music continues) So, yeah, I've been deep in
the context, and the history, and the data for all of this, the stuff I can do from the office, but the fact is time is running out. (active music)
I need to find someone on the ground, someone in Doha, someone in Bangladesh or
Nepal who can help me capture what is actually
happening in these places, talk to the people there. I've been planting lots of seeds, and some of them are starting to sprout, so we're getting closer. We're getting closer.
(mouse clicking) (inquisitive music) - Hey, I've been talking
with a journalist in Nepal who's really great and can
connect us with workers who've returned home. He's done a lot of work on this, and he can go out and
shoot these interviews. (inquisitive music continues) - I'm finally just settling into the fact that I'm not going to Doha,
and I'm disappointed in that because I wanted to be on the ground. I wanted to see this issue,
but the right choice is to use those resources
to engage camera people to go capture the right stories in different parts of the world, and that's what we're gonna do. Luckily, I've got Instagram.
(upbeat music) I also have miso soup. (Johnny slurping) Hey, Sandra, thanks so
much for reaching out. I really appreciate it. I'm doing this deep dive on the World Cup. Put a call out for people
in Doha to help me out here. I was gonna be going to Qatar, and I was gonna be there
next week, but I'm not going. I'm now looking for people
on the ground to help me, and as always, a bunch
of people responded. I live in a world where I
can just ask for things, and there's such a supportive community who wants to help with these stories, which is just an amazing reality. Probably 15 to 20 hours
over the next two weeks getting some shots. Can I officially, you know, hire you as a contractor to do this? And again, all of this is 100% anonymous. We will make sure that everyone is safe. (lips fluttering)
(inquisitive music continues) Bingo, yes, yes, yes. I am talking to somebody in
Qatar who is a journalist who wants to help me out and is excited. Oh, my god, I feel so much better. There is someone in Doha
who has camera skills, there we go, who has language skills, who has journalism skills,
who's excited to help and is just ready to go. Oh, my gosh, nice to meet you (laughs). - [Raj] Hello. - How you doing? - [Raj] Yeah, everything's great. - Really appreciate you just, like, harnessing the energy on this
and just being super down. And they have access
to the Industrial Area. Yes. I want you to tell me
how comfortable you feel about this process in terms
of safety and security, what's sensitive, what's not. Just gimme an overview of
where some red lines are here. I found someone in Doha who I could give a camera to to film. We're gonna call him Raj. We won't be showing his face. We'll change his voice because he could get in
deep trouble for this. - [Raj] First things first,
everything is monitored, or, like, surveillance works
everywhere in this country. No matter where I film,
I'm also being filmed. Specifically, if you come
to the Industrial Area, there are a few layers to what we can do and what we cannot do. - [Johnny] And over the next several weeks of talking to Raj, I
realized that my fixation on this one blue square isn't
actually the full story. It's just the beginning. - [Raj] I plan to go on every street and film from inside the car, and I think that's the safest way to film and get, like, the vibe of what is it like to get inside the city. (ice cubes clinking) (Johnny exhaling)
(glass thudding) - We have someone on the ground with a camera that we bought them. I've lined them out on
how to shoot undercover. - [Raj] I actually
wanted to ask you, like, how do you get along shooting footages without getting noticed? - The key to filming without being seen is to look elsewhere. You're holding this thing like you're holding a an ice cream cone. - [Raj] Yeah.
- You're walking around, and you're looking elsewhere, and then you just smoothly,
you know, put it away, and you just get really comfortable with turning it on and off. They're going to the Industrial Area. They are very, very cautious
for a very good reason. I would like you to shoot
in 60 frames a second. I'd like you to shoot in 4K. This is gonna be an amazing
story if we can pull it off. 'Kay, goodbye.
- Talk to you soon. - The government of Qatar is way more insane than I
expected, and we're gonna take a lot of precautions
to keep everyone safe. We're gonna show the world what Qatar doesn't want the world to see. (tense music) - [Raj] So, I'm an Uber because, frankly, it's
very unsafe to go on a bus. This is the bus stop where you get on a bus to the Industrial Area. How much time does it
take for you to get here? It should be like one
and a half hour, right? - Raj was finally heading
to the Industrial Area to show us exactly what this place was. But it wasn't until we
heard from the people who had worked there and lived there that we began to see how
deep this trap really was. Today is the day. In Nepal, a million miles away, they have been shooting interviews. Look, these are people who actually worked on the World Cup stadiums and
are now back home in Nepal. You start to get to the human side of it, and it becomes way less theoretical. It's way less about these
zoning maps and stuff, and it becomes about real humans, and this where it starts to get heavy. (dramatic music) (Goma speaking in foreign language) (footsteps plodding) (Bikram speaking in foreign language) (dramatic music continues) (Sushil speaking in foreign language) (child speaking in foreign language) - As we've been setting
up all these logistics and figuring all of this out, (mouse clicking) we've also been reporting
and investigating the bigger context here. The Industrial Area,
this little blue shape on the map is
(paper rustling) actually just one of several mechanisms that the Qatari government
uses to bring people over to their country to trap them there and then to exploit them to work to build all the things they want them to build. (paper rustling)
(pensive music) Lemme show you. Okay, so it's 2010. Qatar just won the World Cup bid. They have to build an unfathomable
amount of infrastructure in a very short time. They do this by paying a bunch of people to go to these countries,
to small villages in places like Bangladesh and Nepal to recruit a bunch of workers
to come to Qatar to build. And this is the first phase of what I'm calling the Qatar trap because it is here where
these workers were told they had to pay a recruitment fee, usually like one to $4,000
just to, like, get recruited to go to Qatar and work. These people don't have
one to $4,000 lying around. So, they often would
borrow money from family or take out a loan with
really high interest rates. So, even before they start working, they start their relationship
with work in Qatar with debt. So, now you have workers from
Bangladesh, India, Nepal, all over this region flooding
into Qatar to start building. As this is happening,
Qatar implements a law. (dramatic music) This is a law that's
meant to protect families. Okay. The law says that worker
groups are not allowed to live within, quote, ""family
areas"" in the city of Doha. It's a little ambiguous. Well, the government later clarified that what they're
referring to is bachelors, people in Qatar that are single men. Okay, so these bachelors
can't live in family zones. Where are these family zones
that bachelors can't live in? Is it just like one
little part of the city? (inquisitive music)
No. To clarify, they released
a map that looks like this. Everything in yellow is a family zone, a place where bachelor workers
are not allowed to live. If you project it onto, like, a real map, you will see that this is
the entire city, basically. And then, they reserved one
little plot of land a city away, still zoned for Doha,
this little blue shape, where these bachelor workers can live. Oh, but they made a few exceptions. Anyone who works at, like,
markets, and barber shops, restaurants, oh, and
white collar professionals who are bachelors can also
stay in the family zones. So, really these working
bachelors is just a euphemism for guys who look like this, guys who are there doing construction who Qatar does not want to see
in their shiny downtown area. So, they reserved them a spot out here in the desert next to the sewage pond. This is the map that sent
me down the rabbit hole, and now I see it for what it is. I knew something was up. I looked at a bunch of these
(censored) zoning maps. They're using this to put the people that they don't wanna see in the places that will never be seen. So, now these guys are
already laden with debt because of the recruiting fees, and now they're relegated and trapped into this part of the
city, the part of the city that I was not allowed to go
to without getting arrested. This is where Raj is on his way to. This is where we're getting footage from. (tense music) - [Raj] 50 minutes into the ride, and we're kind of starting to see these kind of accommodations
where the workers live. This is one of those
buses that the workers that live in the Industrial
Area use to commute. Today is Friday, and it's a leisure day for a lot of workers, as
you can see a lot of clothes that have been washed and
left in the sun to be dried. - So, this is the Industrial Area. It's the thing I've been thinking about for a very long time, and I'm finally seeing
the footage from inside, and I have to say, it's not
anything super surprising. This is kind of anti-climatic in the sense that I'm just looking
at like a kind of dusty, dilapidated part of town
with a bunch of buildings that look the same, and
yet, I now know a lot more about what this place represents. Look at this. The Industrial Area isn't just far away. It's completely cut off. Here's the metro system, brand new, that they were planning to
build for the World Cup. This is a whole system, connects all of the stadiums and the city. You can see that they planned
a couple of these lines to go out to the Industrial Area. This would connect the
Industrial Area to the city, and yet, these (laughing)
lines aren't actually built. They're gonna start on these right after the World Cup is over. So, yeah, this place is just,
like, completely disconnected. I think I now see that, and it's not just
disconnected unintentionally. This is very systematically,
intentionally disconnected from the rest of the city. Our interviews in Nepal
gave us some clarity on what it's like to live out there. (mouse clicking) (Sushil speaking in foreign language) (Sushil speaking in foreign language) - The next phase of the
Qatar trap has to do with how these people were exploited, how their rights were taken away from them to force them to work. (pensive music) To build the World Cup,
these workers were forced to work in very horrible conditions. Look at the temperatures
in Doha in the summer, getting close to 50 degrees Celsius, close to 120 degrees Fahrenheit. They literally have
air-conditioned outdoor spaces. Look at that, air conditioning
outside on wheels. The stadiums themselves
will have air conditioning. And yet, these workers are out there doing, like, manual labor in this heat. (Bikram speaking in foreign language) - A lot of workers report
being treated like animals, being yelled at and bossed
around in totally inhumane ways. (Bikram speaking in foreign language) - Behind these walls, the conditions that these people were made to live in and really given no choice on where they could live are horrendous. (Bikram speaking in foreign language) (Sushil speaking in foreign language) - Journalists and human
rights organizations have actually gotten cameras
back here to actually show what that looks like. The heat and conditions
got so bad for some workers that they never returned home. (Goma speaking in foreign language) (dramatic music) (Goma speaking in foreign language) (Goma speaking in foreign language) (Goma speaking in foreign language) (camera clicking) (Goma speaking in foreign language) - Thousands of totally
healthy young men died while working in these conditions. (inquisitive music) We'll likely never know
the true cause of death because instead of a real investigation, the Qatari authorities come out and use these vague classifications
like heart failure and natural causes as the cause of death. Doing this robs the family of answers on why their loved one came home in a box. (Goma speaking in foreign language) (gentle music) - So, if these employers are so bad, why don't these employees
just change jobs? The answer is they can't. (pensive music)
For a long time, legally, they couldn't because the next part of this trap has to do with paperwork. (Sushil speaking in foreign language) (Sushil speaking in foreign language) - Oftentimes this
paperwork would stipulate that these workers can't change jobs without the permission of their employers. So, the status of these
workers who were trapped in their little blue box on
the outskirts of the city was completely at the mercy
of their employers. If they left their job,
they would be considered a foreign immigrant illegally there and could be arrested and put into jail. (Sushil speaking in foreign language) - Just one more layer of the trap. And then, there was the fact that these employers would
often not pay their workers for months at a time
withholding wages from them and thus increasing their
leverage and power over them. And with no recourse, these workers couldn't
do anything about it. So, yes, we are now talking about forced labor with no compensation, a euphemism for modern-day slavery. I know that sounds dramatic, but that's literally
what is happening here, not to all workers. There were workers who
had great conditions and who got paid on time, but this system enabled firms
to so deeply exploit workers because it gave them
so much power over them and so little recourse for these workers to complain or do anything without being punished or arrested. So, with with no other options, some workers turned to their
last resort, protesting. (dramatic music) (protestors speaking in foreign language) (Sushil speaking in foreign language) (Sushil speaking in foreign language) (protestors speaking in foreign language) - Here they are blocking
traffic, central Doha. (mouse clicking) But don't be fooled here. This wasn't some worker uprising. This type of thing is illegal in Qatar, an authoritarian police state where assembly like this
is totally not okay. So, what happened is the
police would show up, squash these protests, tell them that everything was gonna be okay and they would get paid and then deported a huge number of these people,
got them outta the system so that the status quo could remain. - [Raj] Just dehumanizing
people that belong to a certain race and are brought here for certain purposes is
not justified by any means. - Thanks to international scrutiny, Qatar started to make some reforms. They realized this wasn't gonna fly if they were gonna host the World Cup. So, they started instituting
things like worker hours that were not in the heat of the day, mandatory water on site so these
people could stay hydrated, a minimum wage, changing the law so that people could
technically change jobs without permission, compensating families for people who died working. All of this looked great on paper, but human rights organizations like Amnesty International
actually have looked to see if those policies have
trickled into reality. And you know what I'm gonna say. They haven't. (pensive music) - [Raj] This is the Shahaniya labor camp. This is big walls. A lot of people live here as well. (pensive music continues) - So, yeah, I really understand now what this little blue box
is for, what it represents. The authorities in Doha are getting ready for this World Cup, and
as the event approaches, they are making sure
that anyone who belongs in this box stays in that box. (dramatic music)
Okay, this is insane, the timing of this. This is literally happening right now. - [Raj] The whole thing
has just been wiped out by some weird phenomenon. - I just got a message from Raj that they are evicting
workers from the city. People who are living
(paper rustling) in the yellow area illegally because of the law are being evicted. It's a couple weeks before the World Cup, and so the timing is not surprising that they are cracking down. (paper rustling) - [Raj] Locks everywhere, everything looks like it
has been done really quick. They are literally catching people and putting them into Shahaniya, which is the Industrial Area. I'm trying to get footages
of them being evicted because a lot of them are being evicted, like, just with two hours of notice. That's what I'm trying to do now. - This is so clear to me what's happening. They're clearly starting to really enforce this, like, family zoning
thing to get anyone who they don't want to be seen out of the center of the city. I've never done a story
(laughs) like this before. This is developing, like, day by day, and all of this reporting that we've done, I'm now seeing it play out in real time as the city prepares for the World Cup, using all of these laws to
continue to hide these people, to get them out of view as all of these international
visitors prepare to come. - [Raj] It feels so empty,
and it's only the small houses that have been evacuated. (inquisitive music) - [Announcer] Strike, against the post. (papers rustling) (mouse clicking) - Okay, well we got to the bottom of it. (papers rustling) We know what know why this
exists, the way it's drawn, what it means,
(papers thudding) who it's for, what it's meant to do. (headset thudding) I did not expect that. I know what's happening
behind those walls, how those people are trapped,
how their families miss them, and how some of them
might never come home. (Goma speaking in foreign language) (Goma speaking in foreign language) (Goma speaking in foreign language) - Now, let's be clear, this happened well before the World
Cup ever came to Qatar. And what I fear is that,
once we all move on, once these few weeks of
playing football are over, we'll forget about everything we saw, and Qatar will have no incentive to actually do anything about this. And they'll go back to what
they've been doing for decades, deceiving these workers,
trapping them in their country, exploiting them, and then
hiding them from view. (papers rustling) (inquisitive music) (inquisitive music continues)","The transcript presents an investigative report into Qatar's treatment of migrant workers, particularly in light of the upcoming World Cup hosted there. The narrative unveils a hidden zoning system in Doha, which confines single male workers, predominantly from South Asia, away from ""family areas,"" an exclusionary practice linked to Qatar's kafala labor system. This classification forces these workers into substandard living conditions, specifically in the Doha Industrial Area, away from the city center. Despite showcasing Qatar's infrastructural progress for the World Cup, the report reveals underlying human rights abuses: exploitative labor conditions, oppressive housing policies, withholding of wages, and unsafe working environments which have led to numerous worker deaths. The investigation involves undercover reporting with local journalists in Qatar and Nepal, exploring the lives of these workers and the systemic mechanisms that enable their exploitation. The transcript also captures Qatar's superficial labor reforms, overshadowed by ongoing violations, and sheds light on the urgency to address these systemic problems beyond the World Cup's global spotlight. The author expresses concern about post-World Cup neglect of these issues despite systemic efforts to mask these conditions in anticipation of international visitors.",Human Rights Issues,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar
UMqLDhl8PXw,Qatar World Cup: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO),foreign [Music] concerns the World Cup it's like the Super Bowl except the rest of the world actually gives a the World Cup is a big deal a country even qualifying for it is a cause for huge celebration just watch the watch this Australian reporter lose his mind when his Nation beat Peru on penalties to make it to the tournament how good is this [Applause] foreign to amplify people's Joy shrieking to the guy kissing the camera to someone stealing his scarf which sadly he never got back and the reason I know that is I have it now sure it used to be your mom's but now it's all mine the World Cup got underway today and we've talked before about the organization behind it FIFA a cartel-like group of scumbags and assorted criminals who occasionally put on soccer matches feed FIFA has always been terrible which is what makes it a little hard to hear FIFA's current president claim that their event isn't just about sport it's a net positive for Humanity this FIFA World Cup a tournament of peace and unity will be the one that brings the world together after some difficult times we should never underestimate the unifying power something so unique has well that is some pretty grandiose talk coming from the star of what the are those eyebrows Charlie Brown but the truth is a lot more complicated than that which is not to say that I am not excited about the World Cup because I am it only happens every four years and I look forward to it the way people with leap year birthdays look forward to leap years with an enthusiasm somewhere between understandable and honestly kind of pathetic and this world cup is being hosted for the very first time in the Middle East by the small nation of Qatar which is going all out to turn it into a major branding event even signing a massive multi-million dollar agreement with David Beckham to be an ambassador for the country which presumably includes getting him to make more videos like this I think everyone knows how much I love food and the food culture is very exciting in Qatar this is what I love you know I love to go to spice markets I love to go to fish markets I love American oh yeah oh yeah everybody knows how much I love attacker but what I love is also we are now in this amazing Place yeah yeah using the traditional spices I love riding I love a bike Community I love being in the middle of nowhere and talking and 18 and this is perfection for me so but I have lost the following food food a taco bike culture and of course being in the middle of nowhere eating and talking they really should have just kept taking him to places to see what they could get him to say he loves for money I love public bathrooms the Aromas the atmosphere I just love them I love cemeteries everyone knows how much I love tombstones and grieving families I love Proctologist offices I just love Proctologist culture this is perfection for me the point is the next month is qatar's Big Moment On The World stage they're hosting an event expected to attract over a million Spectators in person to a country just the size of Connecticut but as you may have heard underneath the fun pageantry and David Beckham doing bad Anthony Bourdain cosplay is a much darker story small signs of which have leaked out this week like in this moment from a Danish reporter but then foreign you invited the whole world to the you invited the whole world to come here why can't we film it's a public place but you can break the camera okay you break the camera okay so you're threatening Us by by Smashing the camera wow just a reminder he was asked how would you describe working conditions for journalists in Qatar and just seconds later a bunch of golf cart goons showed up to answer that question for him although credit to this guy for being so excited to appear on Daily News TV and we gave the camera a little wave before presumably smashing the out of it Russian journalist is just the tip of the iceberg here one that includes a host of human rights violations so given all of that tonight let's talk about the Qatar World Cup and let's start by going back to the moment back in 2010 when the winner of the bid to Hostess tournament was announced by the former head of FIFA sepplatter the winner to organize the 222 FIFA World Cup is Qatar look as a general rule I try not to make fun of old men who don't speak English as a first language but due to evil sepplatter is an exception and him saying 222 like a vampire telling the time will just always be funny to me but that moment truly stunned people because for reasons that it turns out FIFA were fully aware of Qatar was a fundamentally unsound choice for a summer soccer tournament FIFA conducted its own objective analysis of the various bids which found that Qatar was an unsuitable place to host the World Cup and a dangerous place to host the World Cup that the summer temperatures would be a hazard to the health of the players and the fans that Doha simply didn't have space for the kind of Stadium infrastructure that was going to be required they would have to build nine new stadiums and there wasn't enough room for them in Doha so they would have to kind of create a whole new city yeah Qatar wasn't just a surprising Choice it was logically inexplicable it'd be like if the Westminster dog show awarded the best in show title to a tortoise nothing against that tortoise but not only should it not have won it should have been automatically disqualified now the first and most obvious problem was that Qatar is notoriously scorching hot in the summer that is why FIFA eventually moved the World Cup to November but qatar's initial pitch simply pretended that heat wouldn't be an issue promising that they built air-conditioned outdoor stadiums while Qatari scientists pitched ideas like a massive remote control artificial Cloud that they could move around to cover stadiums in shade which a didn't exist and B wouldn't solve your problem anyway it's the multi-million dollar equivalent of pulling down the little car flap to keep the Sun out of your eyes and at this point you will not be surprised to learn of the many accusations that Qatar won their World Cup bid through bribery with allegations including that three of the officials who agreed to vote for Qatar did so in exchange for a million dollars each and I won't say the guitar definitely got the World Cup through bribery but I won't say that they didn't and I will say that they did and what well they deny that there was any misconduct in their bid the fact remained they were going to need to build not just a bunch of new stadiums but also a new airport metro system roads and about a hundred new hotels they had to build so much new infrastructure in fact that even the World Cup's mascot laib doesn't seem to be able to believe what his country has just done first thing I want to show you is the stadiums oh the stadiums it's mind-blowing Arenas designed by some of the best architects in the world this is the same city can you believe it didn't exist 10 years ago now it's one of the city's hosting FIFA World Cup matches you know what life I can't believe that City wasn't there 10 years ago either and it's actually a bit alarming if you drove by an empty plot of land with a sign reading coming soon at TGI Fridays and the very next day drove by and saw the grand opening of it you've only have some questions about how the it happened that fast according to one estimate qatar's government has spent more than 300 billion dollars on infrastructure projects and look they can afford that they have a lot of money thanks to their huge oil and natural gas reserves what they don't have a lot of though is qataris because Qatari Nationals only number around 380 000. however the country has an overall population of nearly 3 million and that is because ninety percent of it consists of foreigners and migrant workers and it's migrant workers who perform most of the manual labor there and those laborers are the ones who've had to build all the new infrastructure for this tournament which brings us to one of the major scandals underlying it guitar recruited hundreds of thousands of workers mainly from India Nepal and Bangladesh through agencies in their home countries just to secure a job migrants had little choice but to pay recruitment fees of up to four thousand dollars before they left the country and once they got to Qatar they were already in debt and trapped in a system known in the Middle East as kafala the kafala system can be a form of modern day slavery and the features of it the mount in some cases to force labor it's true all the new stadiums and infrastructure were essentially built through modern day slavery so we should probably introduce a new collective noun to refer to this group of stadiums a gaggle of geese a pot of whales an atrocity of stadiums the Kabbalah system exists in some form in several countries in the Middle East and under it in Qatar workers couldn't switch jobs or leave the country without the explicit permission of their employer in some cases because they might have literally had their passport taken away and being so fully dependent on an employer meant that laborers had virtually no rights take a niche a laborer from Nepal who maintains that he was routinely underpaid and for doing work in truly brutal conditions I went to Qatar in 2019 on the 21st of March I started working at the Lucille Stadium it was very hot in Qatar it got up to 52 degrees Celsius the first year I was there I used to sweat in the exact way as if it was raining from the sky you know how halt Greek Celsius is if you build a stadium in that heat you should get to own it that shouldn't be Lucile stadium that should be a niche's  stadium and no one should be allowed inside it without saying that out loud and there's something pretty  up about arguing it's too hot for Peak athletes to be outside for 90 minutes but you know what it's completely fine for people to build stadiums in that heat for hours a day and for months on end and that's not even getting into the living conditions that workers there were subjected to we drove outside the city to a place the government doesn't want people to see the sprawling labor camps where the workers are housed inside the men were packed wall to wall ate to a room the heat was stifling the kitchen filthy the beds they told us infested with bed bugs 22 year old coomb lives here among 150 other men they share two bathrooms there's no shower here there's nowhere to wash your body where do you wash your body then buckets hard to believe but in these camps it's routine at another Camp the toilets overflowed with sewage and two filthy kitchens were being shared by 600 men that is horrifying no one should ever have to live like that just wait until laib finds out about this yeah yeah your tournaments built on human suffering buddy and you should know when that reporter went and talked to the head of one of qatar's leading Sports organizations it didn't go well you go yourself uninvestigate it you will see them living in a very you know comfortable healthy environment comfortable and healthy of course in a very healthy environment alhamdulillah with all due respect we have gone to the camps you went yourself yes this week in Doha where you have hundreds of thousands of men living in labor camps some of them packed into small rooms eight men to a room like the one we saw 10 men sharing a toilet no showers have you been to the the labor camps yourself sir I'm not gonna answer your questions you don't want to answer that of course I don't want to answer it and with that we were told the interview was over incredible nothing says workers live in a comfortable and healthy environment quite like leaving the room 30 seconds after you realize that the person you're talking to has actually seen that environment and it gets worse a guardian investigation found that 6 500 migrant workers died in Qatar from 2010 to 2020. now that number accounts for all migrant worker deaths in Qatar not just those who worked on stadiums but the Qatari government's preferred count states that they've actually only been 37 deaths among laborers at World Cup stadiums and of those that only three were work related but if that number seems suspiciously low to you it's because it very much is their preferred count is conveniently limited to the small handful of work sites that were under the highest level of scrutiny and exclude the hundreds of other World Cup related projects what's more autopsies weren't done on most of these workers with one investigation finding that nearly 70 percent of deaths of Indian Nepali and Bangladeshi Nationals were attributed simply to natural causes or Cardiac Arrest which feels deliberately vague because Cardiac Arrest just means their heart stopped which is literally how everybody dies I can tell you with full confidence that his heart stopped is how both I and kid's Rock will die that doesn't mean that our Cardiac Arrest will be caused by the same thing though does it one of our deaths will likely involve a lot of meth a monster truck and a variety of illegal fireworks and the other death will be Kid Rocks and Qatar will argue that they have made some significant labor reforms it's something that the head of their World Cup efforts has proudly bragged about if we look at the actions that the government has taken so far laws implemented and being applied as well the follow system has been dismantled both in terms of allowing for workers to change employers and at the same time also there was the exit permit system they couldn't leave where they couldn't leave without permission that has been dismantled as well look those reforms sound great and to an extent they are but they also have some major asterisks on them workers in Qatar have said that they are still required to get permission from their current employer before they can move to a new job and have also experienced retaliation from their employers when they try to leave but also the reforms that he's bragging about there only began to be implemented in 2018 when much of the hard work was already done so he is bragging about dismantling the kafala system while sitting in a Stadium built using it the only way that pat on the back could have been more hypocritical is if he'd forced a migrant worker to do it for him in a 120 degree Heat but incredibly it's not just Qatar bragging about the progress that's been made FIFA has had the nerve to claim credit for it too all the changes that have happened in this country in terms of Human Rights and workers rights and so on human rights would not have happened or certainly not at the same Speed without the projectors of the World Cup oh corruption Caillou that out of a claim there because you cannot possibly argue FIFA deserves credit here FIFA's evaluation of qatar's bid had literally zero mentions of Human Rights or demands for labor reforms think of it like this if the country had made no changes to its Catholic system in the past few years and instead had passed a law called the doubling down on slave labor Act of 2019 you know what would have happened the World Cup still would have kicked off in Qatar today isn't that right live wink if you agree yeah I knew it I knew you knew what was going on there when FIFA awarded Qatar the World Cup there was only one way those stadiums were getting built and there was only one group of people who were going to do it and they gave them the tournament anyway and that is not the only troubling thing that they had to have known back then because let's take a moment to talk about qatar's human rights situation and I recognize every country has human rights issues including this one for more on that see every other story this show has ever done but Qatar is in some ways Next Level women there have very limited rights they need permission from their male Guardians to marry work in many government jobs and travel abroad until certain ages also because sex outside of marriage is illegal pregnant women have to present a marriage certificate to receive prenatal care which I hesitate to even tell you about just in case the Supreme Court is watching this show tonight and getting any new ideas as for the LGBT community sexual conduct between men is criminalized and can result in seven years in prison and FIFA was not unaware of this set platter even joked about it just days after Qatar was awarded the tournament because when he was asked what advice he would give to gay fans who might want to travel to Qatar this was his fun response then I would say then that they should refrend from any sexual activities you know they say in comedy you can either punch up punch down or co-sign oppressive governments for a quick laugh while looking like the penguin went to Wharton and we all know which option he just chose there get set platter a Netflix special it seems like he's ready now Qatar has frequently repeated that everyone is welcome at this world cup including gay fans but as this gay Qatari man who was granted asylum in the U.S citing the dangers he faced there points out even if that is the case for the next four weeks it's a hell of a blind eye to turn it's like having a household with children that are domestically abused and now you're gonna have a fancy dinner party people can can come in they can bring their kids their kids can jump on the table and they can do everything that they want the children that live there are going to be in the basement quiet behaving and they can jump on the table like the other kids that visited because they will be punished in that household for doing it well now you know that the children there are abused so how are you showing up to our home exactly the Qatari government is engaging in some truly horrendous behavior and we can't just gloss over that and uncritically put it in the spotlight it's an authoritarian regime not male Gibson by the way here's a fun game Guess how many movies he's been in this year you're wrong it's seven This truly has been the year of Mel and none of this the working conditions the oppression of women or gay people was a deal breaker for FIFA in fact qatar's authoritarian Tendencies may actually have been a deal sweetener because FIFA's long had a soft spot for autocrats and I'm not just saying that because they gave the World Cup to Russia in 2018 or went ahead with one in Argentina in 1978 when it was run by a military dictatorship or even that they held the second World Cup ever in Mussolini's Italy in 1934. they've said it themselves FIFA's former Secretary General Jerome Valk once said I will say something which is crazy but less democracy is sometimes better for organizing a World Cup when you have a very strong head of state that is easier for us organizers and even for a quote which is prefaced by I will say something which is crazy that is nuts but authoritarians are good for FIFA and FIFA is good for authoritarians as this critic points out Russia's World Cup four years ago was preceded by a lot of controversy and criticism but that's not what people remember about it what you saw in the run-up to 2018 was a lot of coverage of what was happening in Russia a lot of coverage of the rates abuses a lot of interest in that a lot of Engagement in it and I think what the Caterers will have noticed was how that all vanished as soon as the first whistle blew and I think everyone became captivated by the football the categories know that if they can just get to that first whistle then they're they're over the line it's true to be washed away once it begins and incidentally what a VIP box to be a part of there quick tip for the president of FIFA if you're gonna make arguments about how your organization is a global Force for good maybe try not to sit between Muhammad bin Salman and Vladimir Putin because you want a filling in a real sandwich there and the thing is that first whistle has now been blown Qatar played Ecuador in the opening game of the tournament earlier today so what now well workers like a niche hope that some of the athletes participating can help shine a light on all the exploitation that went into this event [Music] my message for Messi thousands of workers like me have worked on the stadium we did not get our salary our benefits I hope that if you talk about workers like us maybe we will get what we are owed I do not have much Faith but still I have hope yeah and that hope is pretty moving especially given all the reasons not to have any and I really hope that Messi hears that message though given that he plays for Paris Saint-Germain a team literally owned by the state investment fund of Qatar I wouldn't hold your breath waiting for him to criticize them people generally don't openly on their employers unless of course that employer is Warner Brothers Discovery in which case you can happily away because apparently they're too busy canceling shows to notice and and I will say some players to their credits have been speaking out Harry Kane and other team captains have said that they'll wear a one love armband during games and organizations from Australia's national team to fifth Pro the international players union have issued statements condemning qatar's treatment of workers women and gay people but ultimately it's not the players who are responsible for this mess it's FIFA they put the World Cup in Qatar and everything that's happened since then has been a complete disgrace and here's the thing I'm not saying that you shouldn't watch this world cup or be excited about it as tough as this is to admit I will be watching one of my greatest Joys is sitting completely alone in my living room and cheering on England until they're inevitably knocked out in the quarterfinals on penalties but let's try and make sure a line is drawn here because in a few weeks time the World Cup will be over the final whistle will be blown on December 18th in the stadium that a niche built in a city that didn't exist 10 years ago and FIFA will happily move on and while they will point to new human rights policies that they've now adopted we'll see how truly committed to those they really are especially given that one of the suitors to host the 2030 World Cup is rumored to be Saudi Arabia which also uses the kafala system and has an even worse human rights record than guitar look there is no reason to believe that FIFA will ever do the right thing but I would love it if it could for just once in its shitty history find a way to hold itself to the lofty ideals that it has the goal to profess I would love that as much as I love the World Cup itself and maybe just maybe even as much as David Beckham loves a taco because that would be Perfection for me,"The transcript is a critical examination of the 2022 World Cup hosted by Qatar, highlighting controversies and human rights issues associated with FIFA and Qatar's role in the tournament. It opens with a humorous introduction to the World Cup's global significance before delving into FIFA's problematic history, including its claims that the World Cup is a unifying force for humanity despite evidence to the contrary. The transcript critiques the decision to host the World Cup in Qatar, a country known for extreme heat and lack of existing infrastructure, leading to speculation about bribery and corruption in the selection process.",Human Rights Issues,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar

A BBC investigation reveals that migrants working on infrastructure projects have faced abuse and several have died, despite assurances from the Qatari government of improved conditions. The report highlights the stories of migrant workers from Nepal and South Asia who left for Qatar seeking employment in World Cup-related projects. Families narrate the tragic deaths of their loved ones, describing inadequate safety measures and compensation. Anil and Bill Du Mundle's stories of loss underscore the issues; Anil's uncle died in a workplace accident while working in Qatar, and Bill's son was killed while underground on an infrastructure project. The transcript also mentions Satish Villegasaram, a worker injured in 2016 who has not received compensation and suffers long-term disabilities. The Qatari government claims significant improvements in standards, yet many South Asian workers continue to report hazardous working conditions and lack of financial protection. The companies involved either do not respond or assure that incidents are investigated, but affected families and workers express dissatisfaction and distrust.",Human Rights Issues,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar
pgqjGoO1PrQ,"Shearer, Scott and Williams discuss Qatar issues | World Cup 2022",this conversation starts with FIFA's decision to award the World Cup to Qatar back in 2010. we were in the room at the time um it felt wrong at the time does it still feel that way well every country has its own issues Gary including our own country and we're not seeing we're perfect as we're far from it but you're right we we were there and 2010 and was we were as surprised as as anyone was um first of all it was announced it was a summer World Cup air conditioned stadiums uh conditioned Fun Fest for for funds Etc um and then all of a sudden six six years later it's then turned into a winter World Cup three months ago it's then announced the first game of the tournament and this move from the Sunday until until today and 11 of those 22 members that had that vote for uh for FIFA have either been sanctioned fined or banned from for life from football Muhammad bin a man from Qatar who was the chairman of the Asian Football Federation was banned for life also even set blatter has recently said it it was a mistake so that's where we are with this world cup it's a different FIFA now obviously as Alan mentions a lot of them are not involved anymore um what should they have learned well I think that when FIFA awarded uh Qatar the tournament there was Zero considerations for for human rights for workers rights and there was no conditions put in place for the building of the stadiums um it's been 10 years before we've seen any changes in that um so you know to to improving working conditions uh labor laws The only positive is this International attention uh can lead and has led to some sort of Reform um I think it only becomes Sports washing when when we don't talk about it well Qatar of course disputes many of the figures that have been highlighted and FIFA president Gianni Infantino launched an extraordinary defense of the host nation yesterday today I feel gay today I feel disabled today I feel a migrant worker I know what it means to be discriminated to be bullied as a foreigner in a foreign country as a child at school I was bullied because I had red hair of course there are still things that don't work and that need to be addressed but this moral lesson giving one-sided it's just hypocrisy well it was an interesting take and shall we say is it though hypocritical lovers to to criticize Qatar so I don't think I I sit in this chair and I'm not pointing fingers or criticize it's me trying to understand you've brought the World Cup here so I'm coming here trying to understand about the culture understand everything the whole context of what's going on and what the FIFA president said right there what he said yesterday to me is confusing and absolutely bizarre how you can say today I am a migrant worker no you are not and you never will be yes you have moved forward and now there's a minimum wage in this country that happened in the last two years one pound an hour 240 pound a month for your salary is 1.5 million or whatever it is a year you will never know what it's like to be a migrant worker and for families now to lose their loved ones just trying to earn some money it's absolutely bizarre and for fee for what to be awarding clubs what in compensation over two um 100 million for their players to be playing here it's absurd that you're not even committing to a compensation fund for families when we sit here we are in the British country FIFA one of the richest organization organizations for football what was it the great Nelson Mandela was the one that said we can use Fork to change the world well these two you're not when you can you can push sport forward and make social change happen I think on that Alex at least we're here having the conversation on the opening game of the World Cup uh you know the human rights has never been at a higher level the attention on it at the minute and we've got a unique opportunity to have this conversation and talk about it there are always conflicts of interest aren't they when vast amounts of money are involved I mean you're constantly asked aren't you about him but with the association of Newcastle saudi's own owning owning the club how do you answer that well it's not just Newcastle Gary it's it's not just football when you look at the F1 the boxing the Athletics the uh the live golf we use funds um don't get to choose where the World Cup is just like we're done get to to choose who invests in in enough in our football clubs do I do I love the impact that it's had on Newcastle absolutely Newcastle is buzzing and playing some some great football and also do I think the Saudis and other countries should be held to account over human rights absolutely yes um same-sex relationships are illegal here um Qatar World Cup Ambassador said last week he described homosexuality as damage in the mind a number of the lionesses yeah of expressed their concern about that do you share it I totally understand their reasons as well as a whole heap of fans from around the world from the lgbtq plus Community not wanting to travel here and once again we reference giano Infantino from what he said you are not gay you will never understand traveling to a country where you are fearing for your life just because of your preference of who you choose to love there's so much around this as well for to keep saying Gary football is for everyone that's what you keep feeding us with we sit here and it's not because people have not been able to travel to watch their teams to support their team so you can't say football is forever and out of fear and actually when we sit and have conversations about I've had conversations about I should be staying at home I should be boycotting and I thought long and hard about it I think that for me personally it would have been the easy option well you do just that because I I love my job and when I think about it sitting here and having the harder conversations and it's bigger isn't it we're talking about the migrant workers we're talking about the lgbtq plus Community we're talking about women's rights you think about four years ago I was thinking about it this morning I was the first female pundit for BBC at a World Cup you think how far we've moved in four years let's hope in the next four years at the World Cup we are never having to have these conversations again no totally share those thoughts um FIFA sent out a letter to all the teams didn't they're saying stick to football and we'd love to we really would but it's not possible is it Anna well perhaps that's what Gianni Infantino should have done yesterday instead of coming out with that rubbish that he uh that he came out with um if he if he feels that strong about the moment workers and their families amnesty has been asking FIFA for just over 400 million dollars as a compensation fund they haven't agreed to that yet why so we find out,"The transcript focuses on the controversial decision by FIFA to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, highlighting several issues that have emerged since the decision was made in 2010. Initially announced as a summer tournament with air-conditioned stadiums, it was later shifted to the winter to avoid Qatar's extreme heat. Concerns are raised regarding the ethics of this decision, as 11 out of the 22 FIFA members who voted on the bid have faced sanctions or bans, including the then-chairman of the Asian Football Federation, Mohammed bin Hammam. The conversation discusses the lack of consideration for human rights and workers' rights at the time of the decision, noting that reforms in labor laws only began over a decade after the decision. The transcript describes FIFA President Gianni Infantino’s defense of Qatar, where he controversially claimed to relate to marginalized groups. His statements are critiqued for being ineffective and hypocritical, as he does not face the same struggles as migrant workers. A discussion on the broader context of sports investments by Gulf nations, including Saudi ownership of Newcastle United and involvement in various sports like F1 and boxing, raises the issue of financial influence and human rights. The conversation stresses the ethical responsibility to discuss these critical topics rather than simply focusing on the game itself. Concerns about the treatment of the LGBTQ+ community and women's rights in Qatar are highlighted, challenging the notion that ""football is for everyone"" when certain fans feel unsafe traveling to the event. The conversation closes with a critique of FIFA’s failure to commit to a compensation fund for affected migrant workers, despite pressure from organizations like Amnesty International.",Sportswashing,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar
4fOGEGmW6kI,"""I believe sporting events should be held in the middle east."" - Gary Neville on Qatar World Cup",last night Ian Wright he had a say on being here and he said he felt quite conflicted I just wondered how you feel going um I don't feel conflicted um I've been coming over to the Middle East for 20 years and to Southeast Asia I've had sporting business and Commercial relationships with these parts of the world for a long long time and the fact that FIFA have awarded a a World Cup to Qatar in the last few weeks that's come under huge screws and accept that position you know I'm there to be shot at and people have criticized me heavily the Christianity criticized our colleagues on the BBC yesterday for being over here um but the reality of it is ah my view on it is quite simply that you know I detest uh workers rights abuses I ate the idea of people not being paid enough money the people who are working in poor conditions the idea of people not having good accommodation the fact that women's rights um aren't a day or two or there are human rights abuses I can't stand it but they also have relationships in this part of the world and I've done for many many years and those relationships are long-standing those relationships are long-standing in our country with the UK If you think about the fact that we buy most of our energy from the Middle East that they own our banks that the royal family have relationships with the Middle East both sporting and charitable you think about our government our political parties our relationships with the Middle East the old London Heathrow Airport the only Stock Exchange and the fact of the matter is it's football that's actually brought the scrutiny and football tournaments that have brought the scrutiny on these challenges that exist in this part of the world and the way in which these things happen and from my point of view I'm happy for football to front that up you know if Prince William doesn't want to come to this tournament but he's okay with not coming to the tournament but his father take if you like charitable donations that's fine if the political MPS don't want to come over here but they're happy to take money from them in in our country for their political parties that's fine with me but they always say is it as football the next football players who seem to be coming under criticism and from my point of view I have to say that I think that football stands up football players stand up we've got another issue today with the one love arm band with Harry Kane these political and social issues which I'm absolutely delighted to talk about there's a serious conversation to be had because my point always is should there be a World Cup in all parts of the world should there be a World Cup in the Middle East should there be a World Cup in Arab countries that absolutely should be and if we're going to do that then we are going to come across some of these issues that exist in these parts of the world where we don't agree with them but can you not enjoy a sporting tournament and come over and challenge the system over here but also bring football to different parts of the world and try and Advance things and impact things and I will continue to keep coming to this part of the world I'll continue to keep going to parts of Southeast Asia and other sectors like energy sectors um our Air Force our banks our political parties they seem to want to shy away from their existing relationships than they have with this part of the world but football will get the scrutiny football will be the one that gets penalized for it and I personally have been hammered over this last few and that's fine but I'm happy to stand up and debate it because I think there's a serious conversation it's about the West sporting competitions should be held and I believe they strongly should be held in the Middle East okay you mentioned the one love armband we're going to discuss that now because Harry Kane the England Captain was due to wear that one love I'm banned in the game against Iran and he didn't the fa made a u-turn this is what they said about this particular topic I didn't want to have potential sanctions against their England players and that was what might have happened because FIFA turn around and said no you're not going to wear that if you want to you can wear our anti-discrimination armband at the bottom of the screen here it says we are very frustrated by the FIFA decision we wrote to FIFA in September and we had no response righty does this feel like another moment in time another late decision from FIFA where something like this quite an important topic as well that could have been a real statement from England has had to be rushed and changed without a doubt I'm like like I said last night I think nothing will surprise me um with FIFA and and their decisions and this is something that they've known about for a long time and now at the last minute again you know very untrustworthy they've they've changed they've changed the stance in it and for me I think that we've bottled that a little bit for me Laura because it's a situation like Gary mentioned it would it could have been a very like for me I thought it was a quite a Meek symbolic gesture in the first place just the armband but I think that it could have easily turned into some a very symbolic just powerful protest of defiance in respects of okay FIFA you've said that but you know what we're gonna do it because we believe it's right to do but you cannot have a protest without risk that's the risk something might happen you might get booked it's a risk in it so that is why you're protesting so like I say it's um again I don't trust anything what they do and you know they'll probably change something else Nigel it was actually a Netherlands initiative this one love man band do you think that there'll be the same frustration and the same anger in reaction to this from the Netherlands yeah there is if I listen obvious to the to the sounds of the nation and especially after the decision the FIFA made you know just so short in front of the most important game in the last ages for the national team there is a lot of anger and obvious because we are a nation that is quite open and welcome everybody from different kinds of ethnicities cultures um equality and discrimination whatsoever so we're quite an open nation and before us that was a statement that we would give to the rest of the world yeah like we pull part of um of an open open communication but also open openness to everybody that can enjoy football whenever wherever you are so I think in that sense that's there's a lot of anger and irritation and what I what I said as well before and I think you guys just put touch base on it it is also the time that they made the statements like it's more irritated for me because this could be this could be already been discussed two months ago absolutely and I think that's the issue that we have right now now you have another topic that we have to talk about other than the football that could already be resolved two months ago if the head of a government body is the FIFA go to the federations they want to wear the Iron Band and set like an open communication listen guys you know we go to a country that maybe have their own difficulties yeah let's sort it in a different manner yeah so you already have the open communication but now you obviously have a situation that is again a topic that has nothing to do with football,"The transcript captures a discussion on the complex interplay of sports and geopolitics in the context of the FIFA World Cup in Qatar. One of the speakers expresses no conflict in attending the event despite acknowledging various human rights criticisms associated with the host nation. He recognizes the issues, such as worker rights abuses and gender inequality, yet defends the presence and influence of football in the region, pointing out that other sectors like energy and finance maintain ties with the Middle East without similar scrutiny. The discussion further delves into the scrutiny faced by sports figures versus political and economic leaders, suggesting that football has inadvertently focused attention on issues otherwise overlooked. The conversation shifts to the controversy surrounding FIFA's handling of the ""One Love"" armband, intended to display support against discrimination. Speakers criticize FIFA's last-minute prohibition of the armband, perceiving it as an untrustworthy and ineffectual decision, frustrating nations like the Netherlands, known for their openness. The speakers emphasize that the armband was a mild symbolic gesture that could have been a powerful statement if FIFA had permitted it. They advocate for football events in diverse regions, like the Middle East, while acknowledging the inherent societal issues, stressing a balance between hosting events and addressing the area's challenges.",Sportswashing,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar

There are mentions of Gary Lineker and Jurgen Klinsmann alleged as being prejudiced in their commentary, with a specific critique of Klinsmann's comments on Iranian football culture. The coverage is criticized for not airing the World Cup's opening ceremony, which panelists argue should have been broadcast by the national broadcaster given its public funding, even if there were underpinnings of human rights issues. The dialogue alludes to perceived inconsistencies in how different global events have been covered, such as the Beijing Olympics and Russian football events, pointing to a possible double standard based on geopolitical contexts.",Misinformation in Sports,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar

It suggests that Qatar's decision to host the event is a high-risk gamble aimed at placing the nation on the global stage. The transcript highlights negative press and attention regarding Qatar's human rights record, especially concerning the treatment of migrant workers and LGBTQ+ communities. Despite hopes that the actual football tournament will overshadow these issues, human rights activists continue to bring them to light. The role of sports, especially football, as a powerful tool for both positive and negative change is considered. The conversation touches on similar practices in other countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, indicating that these nations use sports investments to bolster their global image while acknowledging cultural differences and historic imperfections in other countries, including Britain.

the media absolutely amazing we're really pleased with where we are I guess we're a bit far out but the accommodation couldn't have been better friendliness just no beer that's fine just gotta have it as it is yeah um they're custom their country go with it we're here for football nothing ever not here for politics or anything else we're for the football come on England yeah anyone any any other thoughts on the accommodation and the way Qatar has been reported in the media and I'm not saying that those stories aren't necessarily untrue but is there maybe a you know they're kind of looking for those things I think they're trying to sense actually there's some things which they'll clutch at a straw and they're hoping to pull out something a bit more than that but a lot of it has been everything's been fine and like I said we're here we really enjoying it that they've been saying about beer this beer that it's not the end of the world the food they've been saying how dare it is it is it just looks somewhere else and you can get we we get good value meals we get good value drinks and accommodation we went from the low cost accommodation we really did the lowest there was and we was apprehensive because we'd heard all these views of the paper accommodation um in the Clusters and um we've got bed we've got hot water we've got Wi-Fi that's working so good and um loads loads of other fans from other areas Mexico Ecuador Poland you name it just one big party yeah yeah hey are you having a good time uh yes yeah we arrived a couple of days ago and like the guys were saying I can't fool the hospitality of the people the friendliness of the people I know there's this big East Meets West thing but you know you just have to expect respect people in their cultures and it's wonderful and actually I think no alcohol is not a bad thing because the enthusiasm you're seeing is genuine it's not fueled by alcohol you know and and I think everyone it's just more of a Unity yeah than sometimes you see when alcohol's involved so I'm slightly concerned that without alcohol we may some people may actually see the football teams what they really are how are you feeling about the game against Iran tomorrow it's gonna be interesting to see how the Iranian players kind of play and perform and behave given what's happening in their country as well as the England performance itself I think just songs we we don't think we're going to Breeze through and think you know it's a England's past form hasn't been that good but you know it's a different time if we pick if we pick it up it should be a good game and well we should be okay yeah but yeah actually you're talking about past form and you've pretty much got shirts from each so anyway that's that's France in 98 that's 1990 20 well 21 21 right yeah yeah I mean how are you feeling about that confident you know whatever makes up we have had a poor uh poor recent form but we played Germany twice in Italy twice you know a World Cup start fresh from everyone you know whether you've been good whether you've been uh poor doesn't matter what matters is if you perform on a day because we all know that you could either be out in two games if you lose the two games but then you can also go four or five games and actually you know you're one or two games from the final yeah Wales is the danger fixture isn't it no I don't think it is I think the USA will be a harder game um I think Wales Gareth Bale FC you mean but no they'll be they'll be fine we was talking to some Iranians last night and they said how defensive they will play they said we're very good defensively but we won't cause you any um attack or Midfield we just won't but we'll try and hold you and that's what they're going to try and do so it's just going to be a case of Gareth thinking right I've just got to work this I've got to work the patterns I've got to do everything not sit back because I can't yeah you're thinking complacency that's they're going to be their biggest problem the England fans it's typical England isn't it they've always won it before they've kicked the ball haven't they and then it's a massive disappointment yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but how you feel how are you enjoying it sir that's great there you go it's very nice yeah people people are great yeah yeah it's really nice clean safe feeling Place uh Goods do you miss a beer need a beer [Music] plenty of bars in town where you can get one yeah you know I just spent in bars it's not illegal anywhere else it's just at the stadiums yeah yeah but there's a great great atmosphere here I know all the fans you can see in England together which is a good thing it's brilliant yeah yeah and how you feeling about USA tomorrow uh yeah I'm not so sure about the USA which

we've got a good chance yeah and then Iran and then and then the big one yeah exactly,"The transcript features interviews with fans at the Qatar World Cup, where they express their positive experiences, despite the media's negative portrayal of Qatar's hosting. The fans appreciate the accommodation, hospitality, and the cultural aspects, like the absence of alcohol, viewing it as a source of authentic enthusiasm. They acknowledge differing cultural norms with respect but emphasize their primary focus on enjoying football. The narrative touches on England's football performance, the expectations against teams like Iran and the USA, and the typical challenges England faces in tournaments. It discusses how the media might be exaggerating negative aspects, as fans highlight good value options for food and drink, and the inclusivity among diverse fans from different countries. The tone suggests that although the media may focus on potential negatives, the reality for these fans has been enjoyable and peaceful.",Sportswashing,1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar
gHjbay54F4U,How Qatar Bought the World Cup,"(crowd cheering) - [Harris] This is just a game, right? But it's not. It's really not. It's so much more than that. (upbeat music) I wanna show you a story that feels unique to our time in history. It's a story of how the organization that controls the sport that humans love most was hijacked by a tiny country that controls the resource
that humans need most. - [Reporter] Qatar wealth
from oil and natural gas. - [Harris] Resulting in this. A world cup held in the desert, in a country built off fossil
fuels and foreign labor with a citizen population
the size of Honolulu, Hawaii. (clock ticking) I wanna show you how this happened. How Qatar, this tiny country, beat out the US, Australia,
Japan, and South Korea by convincing 14 of the
22 most powerful men in football to vote for them to become the host of the 2022 World Cup. - [FIFA official] The winner to organize the 2022
FIFA World Cup is Qatar. (crowd cheering) - Okay. This is a big story

in to this very deep, but very important story. Here we go. (ominous music) We've been deep in this. Trying to make a web. Trying to make a visual that
will help us understand FIFA and why this World Cup is being
held where it's being held. (slow electronic music) I wanna show it to you. And I've been really wrestling
with how to boil this down. And I think there's
just three major things that we need to understand if we want to understand how
Qatar bought the World Cup. Check this out. Okay. There's three major things you have to understand to make sense of this story. They are FIFA. You have to understand the World Cup. And you have to understand Qatar. All right, this is our list. If you understand these
three things independently, you can put them together to determine what really happened here and how this tiny desert country ended up with the World Cup. So let's start with FIFA. (slow electronic music) FIFA was started by seven
European nations in 1904. The original goal here was
to help organize matches for association football,
which is football. It's the thing we all know. It's the game where
two teams of 11 players try to kick a ball into a goal. Football was no means invented here at this time, at this place. People have been kicking a ball around for like a million years. But it was here in
Europe in the early 1900s when the modern authority
for football was born and born in pretty humble beginnings. But FIFA quickly grew into a transnational
quasi political authority that spans the whole globe. In fact, we have a map for that. (slow electronic music) So this is FIFA today. It is massive. It represents 211
countries or associations that all belong to this one
giant sporting organization. The most powerful, easily the most powerful sporting
organization in the world. And it's got these six major
regions or confederations. And it was the leaders from
these regional confederations who in 2010 sat on FIFA's
executive committee, based here in Zurich, in this
bunker-like headquarters. I was actually there just
a few weeks ago actually. I'm in Zurich. This is where the FIFA
headquarters, the FIFA museum are. This is where the votes happened. (slow electronic music) (crowd clapping) (announcer speaking foreign language) Okay, let's get back to this. Here we go. The 24 most powerful men in football. The ones who would go on to decide who would be the host
of the 2022 World Cup. Here they are. They're just hanging out on our diagram sorted by their confederations. Sapp Blatter, the president
right here at the top. Swiss guy. I'm gonna cross it off. I'm gonna cross it off the list. FIFA. We didn't go over all of it. There's obviously way more to FIFA than what I just talked about. The corruption, the scandals, all of it. But for the purposes of this video, we're just trying to answer the question how did Qatar end up with the World Cup? What we need to know is
what we just talked about, the executive committee, the 24 most powerful men in football. I'm gonna cross it off the list. Next on our list, the World Cup. (upbeat music) So eventually FIFA got big enough to where they could put on a
big international tournament and people would actually come. They held it in Uruguay in 1930. 13 teams participated and
they called it the World Cup. It quickly became the most
prestigious tournament in football and eventually would become the most viewed sports
event on the planet. (announcer screaming) Beating out even the Olympics if you consider that 1.1 billion people, like a decent chunk of the
entire global population, were simultaneously watching in 2018 when France beat Croatia in
the World Cup final in Moscow. 1.1 billion people at the same time all watching the same thing. And I mean that's insane. But it's also kind of amazing. Like what other thing brings
that many people together? It is an amazing thing what
global football has become. And that is basically thanks to FIFA. (mystical music) (announcers commentating) - Sport has the power to
inspire and unite people. - I mean you, I'm immediately like, actually almost crying. Like this is, this is beautiful stuff. Look at this. Look at this guy. Look at this. These moments of like
amazing like performance and then this, the
reaction of these crowds. But it must be noted that when you have this much
attention on one event, 13% of the entire global
population watching at one time, it will quickly become less
about the beauty of this game and more about, I mean, you
know what I'm gonna say, more about money. With so much attention, corporations pay endless money to get their logos
anywhere near this stuff. Here or here or here. Okay, that's not that surprising. What blows my mind is how
far governments will go to also pay endless money to get anywhere near the World Cup. Not because they make money in
return like the corporations. They always end up losing tons of money. But because there's a power in having the entire world
focused on your country for a few weeks. - Together, you've given
the American people an extraordinary opportunity to welcome the world to our shores as host of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. - I mean, look at this. Look at this. We plotted this actually. We found this data. Every four years is a World Cup. And this is how much each of
these countries have spent on their World Cup. These are again, taxpayer money here. This is government money being invested into hosting the World Cup. Throw this sucker onto a bar chart and you get something like this. Like it's getting out of hand. Like every year, they spend
more and more and more. Oh, and spoiler alert, wait till I show you this
graph with Qatar in the mix. Minds will be blown. I can promise you that. (electronic music) The point is that countries are willing to pay more and more to get
the World Cup in their country. A moment for them to put
their best foot forward on a global stage. This is what we like to call soft power. Okay. I am crossing the
world cup off of our list. Not because I covered every angle of it, but because for the
purposes of this story, this is what matters. Countries are more and more
willing to pay unlimited amounts of money to try to get
this event in their country because a billion people
are gonna watch it. It makes them look good. Okay? We're crossing it off. All right, onto the last
piece of our puzzle. Qatar, a country that
should be pronounced Ga-tar, but I'm not gonna be that pretentious guy who shows up trying to like say it in the local pronunciation cuz it makes me sound cultured and cool. I am that guy. I'm trying to not be that guy. So for now, I'm just going to say it like a Texas
oilman says it, Qatar. Okay? Thanks. (slow electronic music) I'm gonna be really quick
on this history of Qatar. Like we're not going into
the full thing, okay? This is a very juicy history that I could easily do
a whole video about. I'm gonna give you the sparknotes, which is that Qatar,
for most of its history, was populated by nomadic
tribes and fishing villages whose biggest industry was pearl diving, which is like, a pretty
gnarly thing to do. Like you like tie a rock around your ankle and go under to find clams
and then open the clams and see if there's pearls. It was like hard work. The British eventually swooped in because the industrial
revolution was happening and they smelled oil over here. Qatar becomes a British
protectorate until 1971 when they became an independent country and Islamic constitutional monarchy, run by one family dynasty. So by the seventies,
the British were gone. But crucially, the oil was not. And because of said oil, Qatar quickly transitioned from a poor tribal society to a globally connected energy
hub with unlimited money. This accelerated in the seventies when Qatar won the fossil fuel lottery and discovered that they just happened to be sitting on the largest
known natural gas field on the planet. This guy. They share a bit of it with the territorial waters of Iran, but most of it is theirs. (slow electronic music) Oh, and by the way, all this fossil fuel and
the revenue coming from it belongs to this teeny country, which this is a very teeny country. Like we're talking about a country that fits inside of the
sole of the boot of Italy. Look at this. I mean it doesn't totally fit. It's like, but it's tiny. And we're talking about a few
hundred thousand Qataris here. This isn't a big population and yet they're all getting in on this unbelievable amount of wealth. Like we can't fathom how rich this teeny little thumb shaped country is. They could not spend
their money fast enough. They didn't have enough
labor to build all the stuff that they had money for. So they started to import
labor from other countries. 95% of the people who live
and work here are not Qataris. They're expats from other places. 95%. Meanwhile, the teeny population that are actually Qatari
citizens live very good lives. They're some of the richest
people on the planet. Most of them work very
cushy government jobs that pay really well. They live in a welfare state
where their needs are met because there is just unlimited money for everyone in this country. Okay, that's Qatar. (upbeat music) So this is the moment
where the three pieces of our puzzle come together. Because in the nineties, Qatar starts to read the tea leaves. They start to realize that
the world is gonna move away from fossil fuels, the
one thing that they have. Their gravy train is gonna come
to an end in a few decades. It's time to prepare for
the future, said Qatar, by investing their billions and billions, hundreds of billions of extra dollars into anything and everything
that is not fossil fuels. Diversify. So they start to go nuts. Everything from real estate
in Singapore and New York City to buy the St. Petersburg
Airport in Russia to buying Miramax Films and the Italian luxury brand Valentino. Like, boy, should I just
make an entire video on Qatar Investment Authority? Cuz that would be juicy. In 2017, the BBC noted
that Qatar owns more land in the UK than the Queen does. And as a part of this big diversifying strategic
investment effort, Qatar focused on turning their country into a global hub for
prestigious international events. You see where I'm going with this? Lucky for them, there is a shortcut to the most prestigious
event in the world. The World Cup. (upbeat music) Oh, and this event happens
to be run by an organization that speaks a language that
they're very familiar with. The language of money
and power and influence. And here's where we are. (slow electronic music) So we're back here to this web. These gatekeepers of
international football, the people who voted on who was gonna host the 2022 World Cup. 14 of these guys voted Qatar. And I want to know why. Qatar, a country that FIFA itself, when they were evaluating all
the bidders for the hosting, decided was not super suited for this. There's all these parameters that countries should
have to be a good host. Qatar didn't really have a lot of 'em. And in fact, they had the opposite. Super hot weather. No widespread football infrastructure. And perhaps most strikingly, not a huge tradition of football or even a significant local population to spread football to in their place. Like they have a couple
hundred thousand people. The World Cup is supposed to
bring football to new regions and spread it throughout a country. How are they gonna do
that in a hot desert oasis with like 300,000 people? So let's do this. We're done with our list. Let's move on to the
next part of this video, which is probably the part
we put the most effort into. And I want you to stick with me here because the point isn't to
go into every single detail of how some of this corruption went down. No one's gonna remember
every little detail. That's not the point. The point is to give you a
sampling of the mechanics of how influence and power works. Not just in FIFA, but in the
international system generally. How powerful people get what they want. We'll never know for certain
because this vote was secret. But we know Qatar got 14 of these guys. And I think I have a
pretty good idea of how for most of them. (slow electronic music) We're gonna start with this guy. This is Mohammed Bin Hammam. He's one of the executive
committee members and he's from Qatar. Okay. We can safely assume
that he probably voted for his own country. But more importantly, it was him, a big wig, international football guy who helped pull the strings
on everyone else on this web starting with this guy. Jack Warner. He's an executive committee member from Trinidad and Tobago. Leaked emails and bank records obtained by the Sunday Times revealed
that before the vote, Bin Hammam deposited $450,000 directly into Warner's account. And later even more,
totalling $1.6 million. Just like literally,
like he just paid him. Like that's, this is the simplest version. Just like I will pay you money to give to, so you do what I want you to. It's just like so straightforward. No wonder a month after
the vote, in an email, Warner called his Qatari
colleague Bin Hammam, quote, ""the only brother I have in football."" Okay. One guy down. Who else? Next, we have the three
executive committee members from the South American Confederation. The US Department of
Justice has gotten involved with these guys. They recently released
an unsealed indictment against all three of them, alleging that these three were quote, ""offered and received bribes
in exchange for their votes."" I mean, it's pretty unsatisfying. We don't have the evidence
that the DOJ is using for this case, but
they're building a case. Oh, and by the way, two of these guys just died in like the past couple of years. Next up, we've got these three guys from the African Confederation. A year before the vote, the African Confederation was
having their annual meeting in Angola, which by the way, was paid for by the Qatar bid team. The people who were like
trying to convince people to vote for the World Cup. They paid for the whole thing. Okay. I get it. Trying to lobby for your team. That's fine. But here's where it gets shady. While they were at this meeting, the Qatar bid team met with these three executive
committee members. And according to a former employee who was in the room translating, the Qataris offered 1.5
million dollars each to these guys in exchange
for their promise that they would vote for Qatar. A year later, this employee turned
whistleblower actually went back on her statement, saying that
she actually lied about it and that there were no bribes. Kind of fishy. What's your incentive to lie? But then the FBI showed
up at her front door and she admitted that she was pressured to say that she had lied about it and that actually the bribes happened. I don't know, man. We don't like... I side with the whistleblower. You can decide how you feel. And now her life is basically ruined. She said in an interview that quote, - I will always look over my shoulder for the rest of my life. - Oh, okay. And while
we're talking about this, one of those three guys that apparently got 1.5 million dollars was later filmed by undercover reporters negotiating an $800,000 bribe
in exchange for his vote. Like smoking gun evidence. Same thing happened to this guy, the executive committee member
from the Oceania region. And they actually got
disqualified from voting. So these two guys didn't actually vote. So we're now down to 22 exco members. Let's keep going. (slow electronic music) Okay, so we've gone over the instances where there was direct money given in exchange for the promise to vote. The next phase of the story
are more subtle versions of influence. Less overt. Less smoking gunnish. Like this guy from Thailand. He's the executive committee
member from Thailand. Four months before the vote, Thailand and Qatar were
renegotiating an energy deal. Thailand was trying to get a better price for their natural gas, something Qatar has a lot of. But for some reason, this guy, a FIFA executive committee
voting member was at the meeting. Wait, what? Why is this football guy in the room while there's these big
gas negotiations going on? Yes, I'm being coy. We know where this is going. I mean, you gotta read
these leaked emails. They're so juicy. You've got a FIFA guy
emailing a Qatar gas guy from Qatar Petroleum. They're talking about the development of their two football associations from their different countries and then saying that they're gonna liaise with the CEO of the gas company to follow up about a
liquid natural gas sale. I mean, it's just so clear
what's going on here. Favorable terms of the
deal in exchange for, ""Hey dude, make sure to
vote for our country."" (slow electronic music) Oh, and who was this meeting between the gas guy and
the FIFA guy arranged by? You guessed it. This guy, Mohammed Bin Hammmam, the executive committee member from Qatar who's pulling all these strings. Oh, by the way, just a
little side note here. Going through these leaked emails, I couldn't help but notice
that the FIFA guy's email was sour_piggy@ redacted. (chuckles) Sour piggy? Sour piggy. Sour piggy's doing a lot of corruption. Okay. (chuckles) - [Cameraman] I'm cutting, dude. - Oh shit. Okay. Okay. Okay. And then there's a few just like, sort of circumstantial ones that give you a flavor of how this works. Like this guy who sold his family's land to Qatar a year after the
vote for 27 million pounds, which was like way over asking price. And this executive committee member whose son was given a job
at a private Qatari hospital shortly after the World Cup vote. Both of these guys, of course, like everyone else on this list, denies any connection,
that this was influenced. But now we're at the most
significant moment in all of this. The thing that really tipped
the scales for the vote. And it has to do with this confederation. The most powerful, the
European Confederation. Specifically this guy, Michel Platini. A former French football
player turned FIFA guy. He was the president
of this confederation, which inevitably meant that he has sway over these other dudes. Just one week before the
vote, like crunch time, Platini got an invitation
that he couldn't refuse. A luncheon with the French
president at his palace. Platini later said that
before this meeting, he was planning on voting for the US to host the World Cup in 2022. But he goes to this luncheon
and who else is there? No big deal. Just these two guys, the
most powerful dudes in Qatar. One of them, the prime minister of Qatar and the other, the current Emir of Qatar from like the old dynasty family. It's important to
remember the context here. Like what's happening. This is 2010. The world has just been rattled by a global financial meltdown and the president of France, Sarkozy, is stressed and he's in the room with the leaders of Qatar who are not nearly in the
same financial trouble. See the section before
about unlimited amounts of money thanks to fossil fuels. And it's clear that these
Qataris want something. Something that the Frenchmen
in the room can deliver them. A vote for their country
to host the World Cup. Something they really want. According to sources
close to this meeting, Sarkozy flat out told
Platini to vote for Qatar. Why? Well, we'll never know. But it's clear that he wanted
a few things from Qatar. In this same meeting, Sarkozy told the Qatari
that he wanted Qatar to buy the French football
team Paris Saint-Germain, which happens to be Sarkozy's
favorite football team. And at the time was in financial ruin. After this meeting, a few
important things happened. Number one, Qatar did end
up buying that football team for 60 million pounds
just like Sarkozy wanted. They turned it around and soon
it became a star studded team with merch that's worn by the world's most popular celebrities. And then we suddenly see an uptick in big trade deals
between Qatar and France. Qatar Airways buys 50
giant planes from Airbus, the giant French airplane maker. I mean, if you look at what
one of these planes cost in 2010, times it by 50, we're looking at 18 billion dollars. A massive deal. And in the end, Platini in this room with his president telling him
to do what the Qatari want. We need them right now. And it worked. Michel Platini flipped his
vote from the USA to Qatar. He admitted it later. That's not even speculation. The president of the executive
committee, Sapp Blatter, was pissed about this and later said that this
was the defining moment for Qatar winning. - They have influenced Michel Platini at that time to vote for Qatar. - Because remember, Platini then went back to his European Confederation with eight executive committee
members, eight votes, and he almost certainly
influenced others to join him. One book I read claims that
he took four votes with him. But we'll never know. And then on a cold day
in December of 2010, the day of the vote came. (dramatic music) - [Announcer] The 2022 FIFA World Cup. - [Harris] So on that faithful
day in the winter of 2010 in Zurich, all the guests arrive
because it was voting day. - Every- - Clearly, I think we had
absolutely fantastic bid. - Well, we got a great bid,
so we just gotta go in there and give it everything that we've got. - These 22 men cast their
votes in multiple rounds until a majority victor emerged. At least 11 of them voted
from Qatar since round one. And finally, 14 votes
were delivered to Qatar, a majority and almost
double what the USA got. (dramatic music) So yeah, that's how it went down. That's how it went down. Like, look, we'll never
know exactly what happened. A lot of this stuff we
know because it leaked out and we were able to put it all together. But the fact is every one of
these men has been involved in some corruption investigation. I mean, it's no surprise
that this stuff happened and probably so much more. FIFA is corrupt to the core. Qatar didn't make this happen. Qatar just saw an organization
that spoke their language, the language of unlimited money, and they used that to
get what they wanted. To prepare for the future, to diversify, to get the world to look at them. - [Announcer] It is the
biggest event in the world. - So no, this isn't just a game. The reason why all of this matters is because football can be a beautiful thing. No matter what language someone speaks or their politics or
their God or whatever, they have this universal
language, this game. A global culture full of
screaming and cheering and crying and pride and identity. It's ridiculous, yet so
beautiful, so uniquely human. And in a very real way, football
is a mirror to the world. What's acceptable here in
this most revered sport is what's acceptable everywhere. So by using money and
influence to get the bid for the World Cup, Qatar showed us just how
power works in our world. They showed us who really
matters and who doesn't and validated an old idea that the rules of fair
play don't really matter if you have enough money. (slow melancholy music) Hey, thanks for watching and for sticking around
till the end of the video. This is just the first
of two videos we made on this topic. The next video publishes soon and it's kind of the next
chapter of the story. What happens after Qatar
gets hold of the World Cup and they have to build
all this infrastructure. And it's a very long, intense journey that I go on to report that story and I kind of tell the story
of that reporting experience. So that will be out soon. I wanna tell you about a couple ways that you can support our journalism here. We do these deep dives. They take a lot of effort
and we need support not just from sponsors, but more and more from the community. We have a community called ""The Newsroom"", which is over on Patreon, and it is a place where you can get an
extra video every month. It is a behind the
scenes vlog of everything that happens in this
studio behind the scenes. The fun, the wild, the
deep dives, the animation, the editing, the team, the whole universe that exists behind the camera. I'm just one cog of a very big machine that we're building here. You also get access to my scripts, to interviews that I do with experts that are just like the
full length interview. Have influence on thumbnails and titles and even story ideas. So go check out ""The
Newsroom"" over on Patreon. The link is in my description. If you're a video person
or a photo person, we also have lots of presets that we use to color
our videos and photos. We developed these over
the course of a year with a professional colorist. They're very wonderful
and purchasing those, you can use them and they also
help support us over here. So those are a couple
ways that you can support if you'd like to. Thank you for watching this video and subscribe if you haven't already. I will see you very soon in
the continuation of this story. See you.","The transcript outlines how Qatar, a small nation with immense wealth from oil and natural gas, secured the bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. It describes how Qatar, despite lacking infrastructure, history, or population to host such a global event, emerged as the host nation by allegedly influencing FIFA's executive committee. The transcript reveals various instances of corruption and influence peddling, including direct bribes to committee members and leveraging trade and economic incentives to sway decisions. Notable figures mentioned include Mohammed Bin Hammam from Qatar and Michel Platini from the European Confederation. The narration details the extensive financial investments made by Qatar in world assets to diversify away from oil dependency. It indicates that hosting the World Cup was seen as a strategic move to increase Qatar's soft power, even though the decision came under heavy criticism due to allegations of vote-buying and manipulation. The transcript evokes skepticism about FIFA's integrity, describing these acts as symptomatic of broader global power dynamics where money overrides fair play.

The speaker uses a sarcastic tone regarding criticism from the West, suggesting that Western countries are responsible for their current dependence on oil and gas from controversial sources. The discussion touches on various ethical issues such as exploitation and the geopolitical influence resulting from Gulf investments.",Sportswashing,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar

QPaGtOLkUt8,Qatar World Cup Chief Reveals Migrant Workers Death Toll To Piers Morgan,chatter is not without fault women's rights and gay rights are restricted by Western standards migrant workers have indispitably been treated badly but those statements apply to many of the countries around the world including many competing in this tournament and by many nations who've hosted major sporting events without anything like the furore that's kicked off about Qatar we seem to have forgotten in England that in 1966 when we hosted and won the World Cup it was illegal to be gay in our country moral Halos appear to have slipped over some people's eyes and skewed some rather Salient facts for example there's 12 of the population here are native qataris something William is supposedly sophisticated West would never tolerate the migrants who come here in vast numbers are sometimes mistreated but the reason they're here in the first place is because the wages they earn are life-changing and the global scrutiny of the World Cup has at least led to reforms in labor laws here that will be an important Legacy and one massively lacking after two Olympic Games in China and a World Cup in Russia Qatar is also a significant investor in many aspects of UK life for example it gives us 25 of our gas which is Food For Thought isn't it is our national grid considers winter blackouts with all the virtue signalers back home prefer we tell Qatar to stop sending its gas this tournaments brought the football mad Middle East together as well two years ago Qatar was under a blockade led by Saudi Arabia Bahrain and the UAE now fans from most countries are pouring in to enjoy the football saudi's Crown Prince was at the opening ceremony the Emir of Qatar even waved a Saudi flag during their stunning win over Messi's Argentina there's no denying the Middle East has a long way to go on human rights and many social issues but so frankly to a lot of European countries there's also no denying that this region the Middle East has long deserved its World Cup and there's no denying and I can tell you this is what most people here are thinking that right now qatar's putting on a pretty good show and frankly when it comes to morality are we in England really in any position to lecture the Middle East about laws or values given the way we illegally invaded Iraq 20 years ago sparked in two decades of Isis Terror and at last year's Euros final showed the world that we're a bunch of coke snorting booze sodden brawling firework exploding from backside imbeciles me thinks not well Hassan al-tawadi is the Secretary General of the Supreme committee for delivery Legacy which is a fancy title for he pretty well runs a World Cup here in Qatar he's the man of the Helm of the most controversial tournament in World Cup history for reasons that frankly baffleman and he spoke to me a little earlier today I began by asking how he felt about Qatar hosting the tournament and how he thought he was going we're immensely proud of of the World Cup as you know and everything has been unfolded since uh since the 20th of November it's it's a moment of great pride I mean you know just just if you look at what's happening on the streets people from all over the world coming in celebrating uh the story is unfolding in the pitch the stadiums from a footballing perspective phenomenal great um well Saudi Arabia beating Argentina for the region absolutely well absolutely I mean you know and then and then Morocco just recently beating Belgium uh yesterday I mean that in itself is a phenomenal story as well this is the first World Cup in the Arab world this is the first World Cup in the Middle East in the Islamic world you see it not only in you know not only in terms of the teams participating but you see it in the stadiums I mean I I was seeing some of the punditry where you had the fans it was predominantly red Moroccan supporters and it's not just Maracas flying over here it's supporters of the Moroccan national team from the Arab uh population Living in Qatar visiting qatars Saudi supporters were supporting Morocco Moroccan supporters who are supporting Saudi and Tunisia and so on uh you know for our part of the world for our region this is this is a you know I have to say you know as qataris as Arabs we're extremely proud of this moment how have you reacted as a senior Qatari one of the real key people in this world come particularly from the criticism from the UK for example I think you know from day one what we try to do is distinguish between two forms of criticism there's constructive criticism that we've taken on board we've engaged with uh we've talked to our critics who had a genuine interest in terms of you know progress or working with us towards utilizing this this tournament as a transformational vehicle for Qatar and for the region and as I said we've engaged with them we've discussed things with them and they've become Partners in the end and then there's of course criticism that I think is based on uh misinformation uh misrepresented facts misstated facts and even even towards you know these and whether it's whether it's media Outlets or individuals we've also reached out and tried to engage and tried to set the facts straight um and some unfortunately have not been as as as receptive of our efforts but nevertheless we've always said one thing the most important element is um our response is always going to be by actions as opposed to words the BBC coverage is a friend of mine full disclosure big fan of his work over the years both on the pitch or not but he did a sort of monologue at the start of the BBC's coverage pointing out all the bad things about Qatar I know what I felt was he didn't do that at the Russia World Cup um they didn't run your opening ceremony this time the BBC on the main Channel they did in Russia they ran it for example with the China Olympics of Beijing Winter Olympics yes it seems to me to be a bit of a double standard though well it's it's it's it's it's disappointing you know for an institution such as a BBC you know a particular BBC Sports in an institution that has always known or at least you know as I grew up was always known to be you know objective and stating the facts and allowing for you know different points of view to be addressed and for the audience to make their own decision uh for the actions that you've mentioned for example you know and again in particular with Gary the frustration is that we've reached out to we've reached out to him many times the latest if I'm not mistaken was in February about three or four times for a sit-down and at the very least again with the idea we'll present our case whatever judgment you want to pass later on that's that's that's up to you but at least for us to present the counter argument show you know show what what we've done how we've utilized this tournament and how really this tournament is a historical event what you've seen stadiums what you see outside the engagement the cultural engagement the funds the way people are dressing yeah I mean I mean you know just a little side Side Story you know over the years as I did a lot of interviews especially from back home I'm always dressed like this and a lot of my friends whether they're journalists and even some experts always try to try to convince me to dress in a western way even from the Qatar dressed in a western way why should we fall on you anything frankly whether it's our our values that we have in the UK the way we dress the way we talk the way we drink I'm not sure that we're in any position to take the high moral ground as a country which for example invaded Iraq illegally in 2003 an invasion I opposed as a newspaper Predator does that give us bragging rights on morality with the Middle East I'm not sure that it does I do want to turn to some things where I think I I would say other criticism notably migrant workers The Guardian newspaper said that six and a half thousand migrant workers have died as a result of the World Cup Construction I've looked into this I saw many other fact checkers figures deeply misleading us because it's actually the number of migrants who've died in total in the last 12 years since the bid was confirmed for Qatar of any cause do you know how many migrant workers have died as a result of any construction since the announcement of the bid in terms of you know what we did from day one at least within the organization that I'm responsible for as we were committed towards being transparent and you know capturing any incidents whether it's in terms of you know misses near misses accidents or unfortunately deaths and we decided to capture and we made a decision in terms of obviously work-related deaths as defined under the you know industry standard but also capturing what we consider to be non-work related deaths and this is only purely in relation to the stadiums right and the projects that we're responsible for and what are those totals and that's three work-related deaths and 37 non-work related deaths these are the specific to World Cup construction specific to World Cup do you know how many people have died in Qatar since you won the bid in the last 12 years from any construction related to anything to do the World Cup in other words new hotels new Bridges whatever whatever in other words what is the honest realistic total do you think of Migrant workers who've died from as a result of what they're doing for the World Cup in totality the estimate is around 400. before between 400 and 500 I don't know I don't have the exact number that's that's something that's been discussed I mean there will be people and Sony say that's a lot of people let me say 400 is a price too big to pay what do you say to that what I will say is one death is a death too many plain and simple um and I think every year uh the health and safety standards on the sites are improving at least on our sites the World Cup sites the ones that we're responsible for most definitely to the extent that you've got trade unions representatives of the German Trade union representatives of the Swiss Traders and you accept they have I just just at this point have commended the work that's been done on on the side on the World Cup side right and improvements right but do you accept them because of the improvements that have been made that at the start they weren't good enough the standards I think overall the need for labor reform in itself dictates that yes improvements had to happen and just so we're clear this was something that was recognized before we bid the improvements that have happened isn't because of the World Cup these are improvements that we knew we had to do because of our own values improvements that have to happen whether it's in terms of health and safety standards whether it's in terms of improving accommodations as standards whether it's in terms of dismantling the cafala system now what the World Cup did the World Cup served as a vehicle as an accelerant as a catalyst it you know because of the spotlight which we recognized early on was going to be shed it allowed you know it caused a lot of these initiatives not only in terms of improvement in the legislation but in the enforcement of it as well and that's where today you know where we led to you know we got to a position where our most Ardent of critics consider us today to be a benchmark in the region let me ask you about LGBT rights because a lot of furore about this and in particular the wearing of the armbands so the England Captain Harry Kane and several of the European country captains were all going to wear for one love armband did you personally have any problem with them doing that if it was done specifically to address Qatar I had a problem with it right if it was done some you know for something that was going to be done and the European nations were going to be you know holding it you're just wearing it continuously and constantly then of course that's a decision that they you know that that's up to them it was FIFA right to say if they wear it they'd all get bookings again it's a decision that FIFA's made between them and and the European nations and I think you know became a standoff and that was a discussion that was that was between them for me what I'm trying to you know what what for our position and my personal position is look you know uh we've always said everybody's welcome and and you know we've worked very hard to create an environment um and to ensure that people from all parts of the world and all walks of life come into come coming to Qatar engage and interact with people from the Arab world and the Middle East um even though we might not necessarily see eye to eye on certain things even though we might not agree on certain things um but everybody's welcome and the point is you know to to to come to terms with the fact that we won't see eye to eye but we can still have mutual respect for each other and still find a way of moving forward celebrating together and I think is it safe for gay people to be in Qatar yes unequivocally appears yes and safe for gay people to live in Qatar yes I think it's safe for everybody to live in Canada Pierce but you there would be a problem with a gay couple for example showed demonstrative displays of public display of affection generally is not part of our culture public display of affection is not part of our culture um it's not you know regardless of who you are regardless of your your sexual identification or or and so on public display of affection is not and again I say that and I mean within reason um you know holding hands in the streets is fine uh the gay people holding hands in the streets for anybody's fine it is um but what I'm saying is you know there's there's you know public intimacy you know public intimacy is not part of our culture we're a relatively conservative culture in the West the the individual's personal rights always Trump um let's say the community rights that's that's what's most sacred now there are other societies our society being one of them you know the Arab world in the Middle East where it's the communal values it's the values of the community in society which is also again fundamentally related to religion as well that is that is a that is a you know of a higher value of higher importance and again the question then becomes what is more important you know if you're coming from a western value-based system you look at individual rights regardless of any other uh aspect that should always be sacred and from our part of the world it's the religious values that are there what I'm trying to say is at points in time these discussions you know to try to find a winner out of them or try to find you know for somebody to kind of defeat somebody else in terms of the discussions um the reality is that there will be no winner but what we have to do is find you know or at least that's what we try to do is find common ground find something at least that unites us and come to terms with the fact that we might not see eye to eye on certain things but we have to find a way of coexisting and moving forward and what this world cup is showcased again taking it back to what you see on the streets taking back to it to where you see the engagement taking it back to where you're seeing you know the Brazilian and the uh Saudi singing where's Messi after the loss of after the defeat of Argentina seeing the argentinians coming and you know finding the Saudis and saying where's that solemn when they lost against Poland looking at people dressing like you know I've seen somebody dressing you know wearing the film but in the Portuguese flag I've seen the Croatian flag um I saw a tweet yesterday that that for me was just absolutely funny a guy saying you know never in my life that was I expecting to see a Spaniard rushing because he's late to watch uh the Spanish match holding on to his headgear um what's happening outside the celebration of cultures I want to end on a positive it's been a positive interview um who's going to win the World Cup you know give me a name I need a name it's okay I'll leave it back in three weeks I'll say France France I think France uh led by Fabian and the French team yes I think actually I think England have a good chance England have got a great job Harry Kane remains fit and they play phone but I also think Portugal at a chance with my friend Christiana of course because I think he's got a vision of himself lifting that cup and they have a very good side well you know just to be fair as well for me I want England to win so we're clear I don't want anyone it'd be great to have you know English football history connected to Qatar forever yeah awesome thank you very much thank you very much good to talk to you thank you,"The transcript is a discussion focusing on the criticisms and defense surrounding Qatar's hosting of the World Cup, highlighting various dimensions of sportswashing and geopolitical issues. The speaker outlines how Qatar, amid global scrutiny, has faced allegations of mistreating migrant workers, with figures often misrepresented. The discussion notes reforms in Qatar's labor laws prompted by the World Cup's attention. The speaker points out a seeming double standard in criticism against Qatar versus other nations like Russia and China, which hosted major sports events without similar backlash. The conversation touches on Qatar's significant investments in the UK, such as providing a quarter of its gas, suggesting deep economic ties. The transcript also emphasizes the Middle Eastern unity fostered by the tournament, highlighting historical tensions alleviated through the event's spirit. Critiques from Western media, particularly the BBC, are said to sometimes lack balance, according to the speaker. The discussion delves into human rights issues, particularly LGBTQ+ rights, asserting Qatar's cultural values around public displays of affection differ from Western norms but maintaining the safety for all visitors. Finally, the speaker notes Qatar used the World Cup as a catalyst for labor reforms, while also discussing the challenges of balancing individual versus communal rights. The conversation ends on a positive note about the World Cup bringing cultures together and the potential for different nations to win the tournament.",Sportswashing,0,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar
Qf8TGA2yOKI,Why Did Qatar Host The World Cup?,why did Tiny guitar host one of the biggest events ever the World Cup honestly it's because they're rich as  yeah that's pretty much it they're rich as hell being top 10 in income by almost every list out there so how do this tiny little country get so filthy rich I mean look at this map Qatar is a little nub zoom in and it's desert and sand and sand and sand and oh there's a tree Qatar is Tiny I'm talking only 80 kilometers across Qatar is hot I'm talking up to 50 degree days in summertime and Qatar is Barren I'm talking only around one percent arable land you know because of the sand so this country or region since it has only recently become its own country in 1971 did a whole lot of nothing and the people there did a whole lot of sitting around actually they went out to find fish and Pearls but that could only support a tiny population and then it changed you know why it changed I think you do it was oil Qatar dug and found it in the 40s baby but what's even better than oil LNG liquid natural gas us thank God for LNG because they sit in the middle of the Persian Gulf one of the most drama-filled backstabbing who will bomb who regions on Earth with a tiny bloodstained Corridor separating it from the rest of the ocean which just so happens to control one half of all crude oil exports probably the most important resource traded right now but Qatar doesn't care about all that because their main export isn't oil it's petroleum gas being the second largest exporter on Earth having 10 percent of the world's reserves in their Tiny eez and their gas is relatively homogeneous AKA it's smooth AKA is cheap to extract giving them a Competitive Edge over those Aussies so tons of gas this gas not that gas and tons of sand meaning not a lot of qataris leads to tons of exports Qatar got rich off of petroleum exports almost all of them going to east and south Asia here's their GDP per capita 1996 was the year they made their first shipment of LNG to Japan and really started getting into gas instead of oil and then boom here's the graph after 1996. the rest of what they need eh they can import it food water military slaves everything and I mean everything is imported except for some fertilizers and petrochemicals made here with their natural gas I mean come on Qatar is also naturally shaped like a port catching all the Stray ships in the Gulf they were made to ship their things off by water what else will they do track their gas on a camel through Saudi Arabia which just so happens to be emptier than your DMs yeah they'll ship it by water but that puts them at the mercy of regional politics which is explosive to say the least their relationship with Iran is okay with the US is pretty good and with Saudi Arabia and the UAE is non-existent they do have an open for indoor policy to maintain relationships to everybody in the region ironically to minimize their dependence on the outside but it also includes working with terrorist organizations like the Taliban not the best for PR but hey LNG is a blessing they don't really need to worry about Regional oil politics until there are a hundred missiles flying at their tiny nation and you need to remember that Qatar is Tiny ten times smaller than the Saudis almost 30 times smaller than Iran by population and 4 000 times smaller than your mom by size Qatar has about 3 million people which wouldn't even give it the diamond play button if everyone there was subscribe to the guitar Channel on YouTube but in 2005 they had only half a million people how did they sex Tuple in less than two decades it wasn't the first part of that word zoom in go further zoom in more almost there yes stop that is and he's here in the Qatar heat grinding away building a few stadiums but his name doesn't sound very Arab and he doesn't look very Arab either take a peek at the Qatari population pyramid whoa that's a ton of men it looks like it's gonna topple over why does Qatar have the most males compared to its size on earth like I said before they import everything labor definitely included while the rich qataris do the work hustling away at putting together massive stadiums and flashy cities just get cheap migrants to do it for you hey Petra money isn't any good if you're not gonna blow it in Ridiculous Ways especially when there's only around 350 000 qataris on Earth which wait that means they only make up about 12 of qatar's population and weight by ethnicity they are fourth in their own country behind Indians bangladeshis and nepalis this means Qatar has the highest immigrant population on Earth at over 88 and 95 of people who work in Qatar are bra I mean immigrants with conditions a little uh slave like one could argue nobody brings their families they're only in Qatar to work there are extremely tough conditions 12-hour days in 50 degree weather isn't uncommon and neither is death on the work site there's so much employee abuse it would make Amazon jealous they were originally not allowed to even leave the country through what is called kafala although they say they got rid of it not and the average migrant worker makes about 30 times less than per capita income and around 350 times less than the average Qatari citizen does which means that total Qatari citizen income is 50 times larger than migrant income with there being 7 migrants for every citizen wealth is way harder to measure two and also probably definitely way worse since most of the population is made up of new immigrants fresh off the boat from within the last decade type not the super yacht oil money Sheikh type in fact to live in Qatar permanently you have to spend around 200 000 to even get in talk about bringing Country Club to the next level if you tuned out after hearing all of those numbers all you have to know is Qatar is unequal as jahanam a small Qatari citizen class owns pretty much everything in the country with the bulk of the actual work done by impoverished migrant workers so why is this tiny group of a third of a million people spending so much of their slate their worker their time and energy building the world cup from scratch like I said at the beginning of the video it's because the richer than Richard Rich in the movie Richie Rich and because they're wealthy and they control a huge portion of the world's natural gas supply while sitting in the most trade frenzy region on Earth this small group has a crazy amount of Leverage on the world stage Qatar does not like their power hard it gets too sticky like that in any real war they would lose in about a week but they do love their soft power though you know culture and economics those are the types of battles they fight but if you replace the word Qatar in this video with any of these other Gulf States you would still get a mostly correct video which is a problem for Qatar they need to stand out to their customers they need a larger industry to dominate the gas market they need Regional control over the tight Waterway and when they're tired they need a shisha break and only one of these countries have been able to diversify away from unstable oil while also making the West love them the UAE has a secret weapon the other Gulf States don't have called Dubai they were able to turn a tiny oil dependent City into a rich financial and Logistics Center through their amazing PR campaigns making the tourists forget the city was ever built by slaves Qatar desperately wants their own Dubai they looked at that City and said damn I wish I had that kind of soft power so they went out and bought that kind of soft power out of all the golf countries Qatar is the only one to have a net outflow of an investment not because no one wants to invest in them although absolute monarchies aren't usually the best for competitiveness but it's also because they're going out and buying foreign assets whether it be European sports leagues or American Shale companies Al Jazeera at the state-owned news company has more total Subs on YouTube than Marcus Brownlee oh yeah and also one and a half billion individual users rivaling BBC as the source for international news Qatar Airways the state-owned airline is in the top 10 most traveled on Airlines globally despite Qatar being a cute little puny nation and then there's all the new extravagant buildings and neighborhoods they're making barwa City Education City Michelle Doha Tower the malacatara Banana Island the Katara Towers the national museum of Qatar the Pearl blah blah blah and more and more and more they did us to 5x their tourism numbers in 10 years getting their name out there to the world and hey Qatar is a zero tax paying absolute monarchy so there's no one to complain about any tax dollars being wasted on shiny towers you can't even see the top of but now that they've started there's no stopping what would they do with the sliver population if they stopped building Arenas and crazy looking Towers either they're gonna get a little variety once they all become unemployed and conditions fall even further for them orkitar is going to get hit by a pretty big shock if half of their Workforce leaves the country so they just have to keep throwing Petro money and build even more craziness which all leads to the World Cup of course the next step is to buy the most watched bye bye annual event on the planet it's an opportunity to show the world that for the last decade or two they've been making their own Dubai and this is no normal World Cup it's the most expensive ever by a long shot 11 times as much as Brazil's Copa domondo they want to show the world how much soft power they have even if it's made by a huge migrant population because the alternative is solely relying on exporting natural gas to Asia and praying that that never crashes they have to keep swimming or they'll sink so that's why they're hosting the World Cup because they're rich as and want to stay that way [Music],"The transcript explores why Qatar hosted the World Cup, attributing it to the country's immense wealth derived from petroleum and liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. Qatar, although small, is incredibly rich due to its massive natural gas reserves, allowing it to exert significant economic influence globally. Despite its wealth, Qatar heavily relies on migrant labor under challenging conditions to construct its infrastructure, including for the World Cup. The transcript highlights extreme wealth disparity, with native Qataris forming a small, affluent minority, while the vast majority of the workforce is comprised of poorly-paid migrants living under harsh conditions. Qatar focuses on building its international prestige through investments in global sports, media, and ambitious infrastructure projects, despite having minimal domestic population growth. The discussion includes Qatar's geopolitical position, balancing relationships in a volatile region, and its aspiration to emulate Dubai's soft power by developing industries beyond oil and gas. Ultimately, Qatar's hosting of the World Cup is portrayed as a strategic move to showcase its progress and diversify its global influence, portraying the country as more than just a wealthy gas exporter.",Sportswashing,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar

alacra stadium kata's first World Cup venue construction is underway the World Cup offers has cat a unique opportunity to reform its labor system there are signs the authorities are starting to recognize the scale of the problems their workers face but will they grasp this chance will they turn words into action or will Kata continue to allow its migrant workers to be treated as just another

workers in the country. It begins by highlighting past revelations of labor rights abuses, including deaths among migrant workers, and questions whether improvements have been made as stadiums rise in Doha. The spotlight is on the Aspire Academy, part of Qatar’s state-of-the-art sports complex, where young footballers are trained. The transcript also shifts focus to the headquarters of Qatar’s football authorities, where serious labor exploitation took place during construction. Workers haven't received wages for over a year, are trapped without permission to leave, and live in squalor while awaiting payment. Despite exposing these issues, the Qatari government has not effectively intervened.",Human Rights Issues,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar
qTlG7WyUuLQ,The plight of migrant workers in Qatar • FRANCE 24 English,welcome to reporters plus here on france24 I'm Marco and in this special edition the hidden face of the Qatar World Cup football's biggest Showcase Event is soon to kick off in the Gulf State six and a half thousand migrant workers lost their lives in the construction of the stadiums and infrastructure to enable soccer to be played in the intense heat of Qatar well behind the scenes many more are being exploited unpaid forced labor badly treated While others still have hope that Qatar could be a land of opportunity the shadow workers of Qatar are reported by Chloe Dorma and RAM pateria [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] the skyscrapers of Doha a testament to qatar's Mighty ambitions yet those who built these towering monoliths could never afford to live in one [Music] they stay in camps far from the city center at the end of these highways a Kenyan worker is taking us to visit he agrees to talk on the condition that he remains Anonymous we've named him Ibrahim he says he paid 1500 Euros to a Kenyan recruitment Agency for a Visa and plane ticket he only found out more about the Qatari company who'd hired him on his arrival in 2020 the same day arrived here the same day we started working we used to do that cement like building just Contracting during the hot season this place is very hot the degree sometimes goes over 50. it's not easy my friend you're going to walk outside there the the heat hits you till you feel like you are dying like most foreign workers Ibrahim was housed miles from downtown Doha by his employers in these huge blocks isolated from everything every evening the workers are ferried back here from the construction sites and Company buses with no other means of transports these men are prisoners of the desert going around here at night walking some kind of security people they call police they think like you want to run from the company on his arrival Abraham filmed himself with his new colleagues they were full of Hope their employer had promised the salary two to three times higher than they would get in their home country with accommodation and meals provided their first shock was finding out the state of their accommodation This Is The Life we are living here in Qatar Doha get all right this place is very dirty smelling the life you are living here is hell I don't want anyone to know that I'm doing this in cancer publishing negative images of the country is punishable with expulsion these camps are normally off limits to journalists but Ibrahim and his fellow workers are so fed up with their living conditions that they've taken the risk to let us in with a camera the workers cleaned up all they could right from the start but they still lack basic necessities so come inside come inside some people sleeping in the night some people sleep down here someone do like this why like this the company say will provide us bed the company provide us food system there's no canteen no refrigerator there's not even a dedicated cooking area and this is how we cook our food here just trying to survive here this is what we buy now we don't have any place to go and get some food you say this is what we eat the thing God what is happening to us we are tired now we are really tired that's all I can say in addition to their unsanitary living conditions the workers say they haven't been paid for months every day they promise us to give up the salary and not yet giving the salary yeah it's about a year now not only me but all my friends we try to talk to the company the companies they will take us to police some of us want to go back to their countries some of us want to change companies the company has taken all our passports what should we do here this is slavery this is kind of prison this is a you abusing human rights this is not fair this kind of life is not fair like Ibrahim over two and a half million foreigners live and work in Qatar the wealthy Emirates uses oil and gas money to import workers mainly from Asia and Africa these immigrants represent 90 percent of the population [Music] they were the ones who built all the infrastructure for the World Cup the airports the Metro the luxury hotels and of course the brand new stadiums for this one alone 8 000 workers toil day and night for four years outside this mural claims to pay tribute to their efforts but instead these photos raise questions about the number of workers sacrificed in the name of these Grand Visions [Music] the qataris have already started looking beyond the football championship the country has applied to host the Olympic Games and dreams of becoming a Sports World capital as an Arab and a Qatari I feel very proud that God has given us the chance to organize the World Cup Qatar is an ambitious country and seeks to host the biggest International tournaments thanks to God we now have the infrastructure and the stadiums for this I think Qatar is ready to host any sporting event our ambition does not snap at the World Cup for the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East Qatar hopes to attract one and a half million football fans and supporters four weeks of entertainment made possible by the hard work of hundreds of thousands of foreign laborers we've come to this shopping mall outside Doha to accompany a small group of Filipino workers we're filming on our phones to avoid being stopped by security Rachel in the black T-shirt sends almost all her roughly 400 Euro salary to her five children every month [Music] [Music] Two Worlds Collide in the marble Isles at the top of the social ladder Qatari households with an average income of 20 000 Euros a month for them the mall is a theme park where nothing is too expensive at the other end of the scale Rachel and her friends are just happy to watch it love you I take picture who will you send it to my babies my kids this is a this is the mall Qatar inside Rachel arrived in Qatar in 2018 and now works in a beauty salon run by a Qatari woman her boss sends her out to do manicures pedicures and massages at homes usually we start at the morning 9 A.M until 8 30 like that but sometimes if foreign by their employer and are not allowed to go out alone in three years they say they have never had a holiday Rachel says she was not granted a day off even when her husband died last year [Music] only this first day we get there yeah first time this one every month I have a day off but not the whole day only ours like three hours two hours like that when you came to Qatar you know that you have one day off yeah we know up in the we're saying in the contract but but mostly here in Qatar not follow the rules the the deal we know we have the off that's why I came from Qatar because I know I have the off then but then you know but we lucky today because she give one day off in three years is against the law even in Qatar but Rachel and her friends hope their sacrifices will be worth it eventually often from poor backgrounds these immigrants from the four corners of the world dream of climbing up the social ladder their role models are those who have made it into the middle class like trained teachers nurses or accountants those who work in hotels restaurants or manage shops and small businesses without them the country could not function on the first floor of this building is a water filter business run by an Indian woman farzana Sheikh is proud to show off her successes see this is the water cooler which we are selling okay it will remove the salt and the cloth from the water because here in Doha there is like salty water if you want cold water you can take it from here if you want hot water for a tea coffee Etc you can just fill it in from here so good morning everyone hope this month goes very nicely very peaceful very happy okay and lots of business last month you all did very good business I'm very happy it's very nice okay continue with this month fazana started 22 years ago as a saleswoman today she manages 14 people all of them come from the Indian subcontinent and are making on average 10 times the salary they would get in their home country but they have to earn their place in the team uh Legends Target for this month 15 000 is too less musni for you Adnan also for you 15 000 is too less as if okay because he's just come from vacation 21 20. huh this is 22-25 22 okay I love it and this is my like I said this is my bread and butter this is my everything my house my office everything is here in Doha this is why you came together of course has given me everything every month fazana receives a dozen CVS from new immigrant candidates for these Indians Qatar represents a kind of El Dorado recently come here and because I just believe that that Qatar has so much exciting place and have a more opportunities in India no opportunity to earn more money also no experience that's the reason so all people come okay everyone you all can go to your work thank you very much people die to come here you know anywhere like if you stay abroad they're dying to come here they feel that this is there is a tree of cold here they'll come here and it'll be easy but it's not easy because success you have to have sweat and blood in Doha success comes at a price the law requires farzana to be sponsored by a Qatari the system that keeps foreigners under such a guardianship is called the kafala if I'm not like I'm an expat from India I want to start a business here I have to take a sponsor which will be 51 he'll have for ownership over the company and do they also take 51 of the profits no no no they don't take that they don't so what do they think they take like I said a monthly um uh this thing like we fix a monthly amount of how much they want monthly you have to accept some things you know you have to bend and twist everything the way you want it to happen because it's business you have to be flexible so I can't be hard and fast about anything because this is their country finally farzana says she gets on well with her sponsor a lucky situation for her because in case of a disagreement the voice of a foreign residence does not carry much weight compared to that of a Qatari in another shopping mall we are meeting Ibrahim after going almost a year without being paid the company who exploited him transferred him here for for walking in this mall today I was walking almost 13 hours his new job was to fill shopping bags and disinfect trolleys at this supermarket it's a girl franchise of the French brand Cafe [Music] the Qatari subcontracting company he worked for presented the job as a promotion because they said he would get tips on top of a monthly salary of 400 euros around 50 or 100 qatarians you buy food I was about to say no I don't want that kind of walk because I don't know if someone can give me or not for the first three months we did not get salad but the end of the three months we all strike and the manager also said that if anyone strike again I will Deport him so that was like making a fear to some of some of us the blackmail worked and the strikers went back to their jobs four months later still unpaid Ibrahim and his colleagues protested again trade unions are banned in Qatar and the regime severely represses all demonstrations in the name of security coincidentally the ministry of labor sits just across the street from the supermarket we decided to go to court when we reach in the labor Court we explained the situation that has been happening the labor could tell us I'll do something good for you but I I don't want you to like to strike again if you do this you're bringing the police here and then after a few minutes the police arrived we were all got arrested you were taken to police station some of us who have been released I was one of them and some of my friends were deported we asked to visit the labor courts that Ibrahim mentioned Qatar opened them in 2018 in response to the international criticism over the treatment of Migrant workers in the run-up to the football World Cup we were accompanied by officials from the ministry of information here seeing dressed in white don't film me this employee is giving journalists a tour of the brand new courtroom here's the judge area and here's the members and he is the writers this is where the Qatari Judiciary is supposed to apply the new laws on minimum wage and working hours so we have too many cases like today our committee will start 2PM and then we have today 25 cases a lot we take from the employees like in the work of the liking and the Companions and structured companies we have a lot a lot a lot we are working on to increase the numbers of the course it will be five and with the five judges and we will increase our number for the time being the majority of cases are on hold due to lack of Staff last December the ministry admitted that out of the 2000 complaints it had received only 69 had been fully processed the workers they will get their money from the company from the police from the country from the books they will take it they will take it but then we have charges above the company the company will take our charges but do you have sanctions for the company yes yes it's a lot and in no time though just will come so if you want to see the course you can see it's impossible to film the waiting room or interview plaintiffs we must live with the area okay we must leave yes you all should leave saying that it might not be possible with these legislative reforms Qatar could now boast of being the most Progressive country in the Arabian peninsula but the ministry spokesman appears to suggest that in many cases the laws are not fully applied when we launched the reforms there were of course some Business Leaders who were opposed to them and I think that's normal people often push back against change or new things over but things are slowly moving forward now we're in the implementation phase and we need to face up to some challenges we have to raise awareness among Business Leaders and employees and we have to sufficiently train civil servants in public institutions and Ministries [Music] the work sites in Doha those directly impacted say they have seen some progress foreign our situation was worse before now in Qatar everyone has a salary of more than 270 euros even the person at level zero has a salary above 270 euros it's true that we now have tribunals I can report if there's been abuse in my company but it's not as simple as that I am not in my country I'm not going to try and fight because I don't even know who to approach the truth is that a worker from India Nepal Bangladesh or Sri Lanka is here to work and earn some money so that he can support his family and help his country if he doesn't make it he's not going to fight and tire himself out here at worst he will quit and go home in theory the new laws allow companies like ibrahims to be prosecuted but in reality International ngos have criticized the persistent culture of impunity all our situation was locked the level could try to talk to us don't worry we are processing we are talking to our boss still you lose hope that is what they want do you really need help from these people and we don't get help why after a year of waiting Ibrahim was able to get his passport back and terminate his employment contract but he says he never received his back pay the company in question is notorious in Qatar for repeat offenses like this and has been frequently criticized even in local media [Music] the staff at Doha news an online news website has been following a number of similar cases [Music] uh I'm working on it so I finished most of it yesterday and I'm going to be finalizing stuff the Al Jazeera company nothing to do with the Qatari News Network of the same name has several subsidiaries in the construction restaurants and automobile sectors in this article the journalist investigated a group of security guards who had also not been paid comply with a lot previously we've already reported on it this is like an example of these individual cases where companies choose to ignore the laws like their labor reforms that were put in the country after we posted the story um the security guard that I've interviewed like messaged me and said that their passports had been given back to them and like their payments were given as well so it was good but it's unfortunate to see that two days or two years later the company still made the same mistakes Doha news belongs to a rich Qatari businessman The Newsroom is made up of young Palestinian Pakistani and Iranian journalists most of whom were born in Qatar to parents who came to work here hey for features editor razan Safar this double identity gives them legitimacy to write about their host country so I have like around five videos we try to concern ourselves a lot with the Grassroots so people actually understand how Qatari Society is or understand how people living in Qatar are it's not just a projection of the assumptions um on how qataris live or how people living in Qatar micromarkers are part of Qatari fabric they're part of Qatari Society um they are the people they are the biggest force behind everything all the construction that's happening all the works are happening so given that they're the ones who are literally building the country up of course it's very important for us to shed light on their conditions on their rights on everything that's been taking place with regards to them and then also through that we hope to pressurize the government in some in some regards or pressurized private companies several companies have sued Doha news following articles criticizing their illegal practices the staff say they have never received any threats of censorship from the state this freedom of speech is rare in Gulf monarchies but razan Safar knows that the slightest slip up can change everything with Qatar I would assume the red line is perhaps insulting the royal family and we would we wouldn't do that it doesn't want it doesn't own any benefit it doesn't help anyone so I think personally I think that that's like the the reddest of the lines the other red lines I think it's a it's a trial and error process and we're figuring that out as we go in order to improve its image of openness to the West the Qatari royal family has been trying to modernize and liberalize living conditions for foreigners in a distant suburb of Doha we meet the Filipino employees who are enjoying their first day off in three years they are on their way to one of doha's eight churches here there are no Steeples church bells or crosses outside the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ since 2008 this ultra-conservative Muslim country has allowed Christian worship on the condition that services are held out of sight [Music] this is a gift of the country to the Catholic Church also that we could worship as a Christian majority here is Muslim and we are minority and then just the respect we we don't put cross outside all those things that we do on Sundays we transferred it on Friday because these are the time that people are free despite the difficulties 49 year old Rachel hopes to stay in Qatar until her five children finish University [Music] my goal is for my babies my kids yeah because the value of the money here is good for my my country I pray to God and all this good health and uh finish their studies I always tell them fighting if anything [Music] we get the goal [Music] in a working-class Doha neighborhood we went to meet fazana the businesswoman is out shopping at boutiques run by Indians like her Indians make up the largest expatriate community in Qatar [Music] give me this give me this and give me this how much foreign first opposite now he's got a bigger store like fazana these shopkeepers are all under the guardianship of a Qatari sponsor foreigners in Qatar do not control their own destiny the length of their stay is subject to the Goodwill of the authorities all live in fear of being sent back to their home countries in the center of Doha the mache Reb District used to have hundreds of small shops run by immigrants in the run-up to the World Cup the royal family has decided to renovate the area shopkeepers have been evicted one after the other Hassan is one of the last few still open they haven't told me yet I don't know on the other side of the street they were served notice and everyone vacated the premises I don't know where they went some of them were given compensation others weren't given a thing but now with the new construction rent won't be the same if the rent increases I'll have to leave after the World Cup I think they'll remove us all I'm worried about it so not a citizen but like a residence permit you never know when you'll have to go it's that way people feel that we all expats feel that way farzana is also in a precarious position even after 20 years of living here she still Cooks on a temporary stove because she prefers to send her savings back home thank you I've invested in a house and a small little office in India so that I have some you know ground to step on when I if in case God forbid I have to go back if you're staying here the first thing anyone thinks of is making something to set a foot over there so that you have something to fall back on fazana and her family would dream of becoming Qatari but it's impossible to obtain Qatari nationality except in very exceptional circumstances the rule even applies to jasim who was born in Doha 16 years ago you gave him the test the test papers you finished I'm almost done with it well I think it's it's pretty hard yeah you feel that you are Indian or you feel that you are a Catalina what's your what's your country I mean obviously and then but it's it's all normal over here so everything's good he doesn't like India at all he because he's born and brought up here so he's used to this place you know so he's happiest in his house seriously like anywhere we take him he's happiest to come back home yeah it's sort of become my home country since I'm living here for the last time since up time you're born I was born obviously and like everything is good over here would you like to uh stay here yeah sure I mean I like this country a lot say 10 years from now I should be staying here on the same place with a better maybe a better office better more employees you know grown my plan is to grow more for my business after I'd like to stay in Doha even when I'm retired and is that something easy um I think after 60 it's very difficult to get a Visa you know so I don't know in Qatar the residence permit is tied to a work contract people who are retired or those who are unemployed have to leave the country on doha's Cornish ibrahim's future is looking more and more uncertain he has not been able to find a job since he left the company that did not pay him without any prospects he now risks deportation giving me salary accommodation now I'm going like to my friend my friend tell me like okay today I will go to construction we'll go together I use MetroCard I go around asking for job for job for job I'm looking for the way forward my dream was very big about this country the vision [Music] had goals when I came here I thought that this is the place where I will help myself and help the people behind myself people like my parents my mother because she really needs my help but I did not get anything here skyscrapers nice it's very good but to me I don't see it good I'm here watching these big buildings [Music] whereby people dubbins they've been really suffering Ibrahim hopes to find a job during the football World Cup but he fears he will have to return to Kenya once the tournament is over even poorer than when he arrived once the spotlight turns away Qatar could abandon its labor reforms plunging hundreds of thousands of workers back into the Shadows [Music] our reporters plus Special Report by Chloe Dumar and RAM pateria you can of course see it again on our website france24.com thank you for watching stay with us do take care [Music],"The transcript presents an in-depth investigation into the human rights issues surrounding the preparation for the Qatar World Cup. It highlights the severe exploitation of migrant workers who built the stadiums and infrastructure in the intense heat. The investigation, led by journalists Chloe Dorma and RAM Pateria, reveals that around 6,500 migrant workers have died in the construction process, with many others experiencing forced labor, low or no pay, and poor living conditions. Workers are reportedly housed far from city centers and transported in company buses, effectively making them ""prisoners of the desert."" The narrative follows Ibrahim, a Kenyan worker, who describes paying a recruitment fee only to be met with inhumane working conditions and withheld wages. Despite legislative reforms post international scrutiny, enforcement appears lacking, with many companies ignoring new labor laws due to a persistent culture of impunity. Interviews with other expatriates reveal mixed experiences, with some achieving success while others face exploitation and insecurity due to the Kafala sponsorship system that limits their autonomy. The report also highlights Qatar's ambitions to become a sports capital, with further plans such as hosting the Olympics. Yet, concerns linger that progress in labor rights may not sustain post-World Cup, leaving workers vulnerable. The report concludes by examining the precarious existence of expats, whose rights and futures are largely controlled by their Qatari sponsors.",Human Rights Issues,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar

It argues that Europeans should instead focus on their historical and ongoing issues before giving moral lessons to others. The speaker acknowledges the advancements made in human rights by Europeans but suggests that their own situation may not be as morally superior as they claim.",Human Rights Issues,0,No,,
xyjnDBoJY7k,Why is the World Cup important to Qatar?,the winner to organize the 222 FIFA World Cup is Qatar smaller than Connecticut the tiny Gulf State of Qatar is about to host the world's biggest football tournament but to pull off the most prestigious event in International Football cutter has opened itself to a deluge of negative headlines a collective statement criticizing qatar's human rights record there have been concerns about how lgbtq plus fans will be treated and is estimated to have spent up to 300 billion US Dollars getting ready for kickoff making it the most expensive World Cup in history sort of the the world's most expensive bet on a football tournament so just why has Qatar risked so much to host the 2022 World Cup [Music] the World Cup is an expensive competition to host but accurate figures on the exact costs of building everything from stadiums to hotels are difficult to come by some sources estimate that Brazil spent 15 billion dollars in 2014. Russia spent approximately between 12 billion and 15 billion dollars in 2018 and as of November 2020 it is estimated Qatar has spent as much as 300 billion dollars making this the most expensive World Cup ever cutter hopes the cachet of hosting the competition will help it make its mark on the world stage the World Cup I think has to be seen in the context of attempts to kind of carve out for a separate space in the region that kind of gives it a sense of prestige a sense of influence and you know a sense of identity really in the face of perhaps some of it's more more powerful and assertive Neighbors [Music] FIFA estimates 5 billion fans will watch the competition opening Qatar up to the scrutiny of the world's media [Music] said more than 6 500 migrant workers from India Pakistan Nepal Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have died in Qatar we've seen a few series of questions about how inclusive the tournament will be questions about environmental sustainability questions about of course migrant labor rights 27 year old Shiva tamang died in a building site accident on April the 19th I think a lot of those things have also challenged other to address a lot of the ways that it has conducted its Affairs to understand why the World Cup matters so much to Qatar you have to understand its history and its relationship with its Gulf Neighbors with a population of Less Than 3 million it began life with an Economy based on Pearl diving but the oil boom of the 1950s led to Qatar becoming one of the richest countries in the world per capita but oil came to the rescue of many former Pearl divers the Shadows cast by bigger golf neighbors and the imposition of British rule until Independence in 1971 have made Qatar work hard to establish itself on the world stage Papa had a late start with development and modernization and transforming the country and it wasn't a catch-up sort of a mindset it was surrounded by neighbors who had started decades earlier had the resources had the institutions had the know-how and the experience so much in the Gulf comes down to personalities because these are hereditary monarchies that are often ruled for very long periods of time uh by the same people and certainly by the same family when Qatar switch Focus from oil to exploiting is ample natural gas Fields it became one of the largest liquefied natural gas exporters in the world and per capita the wealthiest country in the region but with the Fantastical wealth created by the gulf's abundance of oil and gas came huge competitiveness all of these countries are trying to avoid the curse of being just oil or gas producers and nothing else other was trying to distinguish itself from the crowd by investing in sectors that were different but also making political choices that were at times at odds with what neighboring countries wanted or expect or would normally tolerate having phenomenal wealth in a country that has the tiniest of populations means having effectively unlimited resources to spend on all sorts of projects meant to build its Prestige around the world we've seen a massive investment in things like sports medicine facilities and museums in universities as well as education and culture and so there was a sense that there was kind of a plan at work three two one the next part of the master plan was to take on the media launching Al Jazeera enabled Qatar to portray itself as a beacon of openness in what many regard as a repressive region the CNN of the Arab world all of a sudden there was a pan-arab network bringing multiple perspectives showcasing the internal debates within Arab society and then of course bringing coverage of things like the US invasion of Afghanistan in Iraq or the Palestinian tefada or of course later on the Arab uprisings that emerged in 2010 and so Qatar being kind of at the Forefront of that was in some ways a recognition that it wanted to carve for itself a distinct place in the region that was not like that of its neighbors for instance Iran or Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates focusing the spotlight on its neighbors raised tensions but this was only the beginning of qatar's ambitions [Music] in 2009 Qatar made its biggest play yet bidding to hold the World Cup in a country with just one fifa-regulated stadium and a climate so hot the grass requires its own air conditioning baffled many I think there was a lot of confusion around the world not only about why this small country had been given it but whether it would be able to prepare you know for the influx of a million fans over the course of a month in a country that at the time only had about 2 million people living in it but for Qatar it was an obvious opportunity you can think of the bid to host the World Cup and the massive Investments made by father in the last decade to organize the tournament as a deliberate exercise in economic diversification this is a sector that you could invest in possibly and that will pay off for you into the future since it won the bid to host the transformation of the country has been colossal eight new stadiums airport and Road expansions hotels hospitals and a Metro System have all been built to accommodate this huge event [Music] a significant amount of money spent in the organization of a tournament that in the process brings about development Prosperity progress and shapes the image of the country in the eyes of the world I think has been a good bet but qatar's gamble to position itself as a major player almost backfired with its neighbors when on June 5th 2017 Saudi Arabia UAE Bahrain and Egypt cut all Land Air and sea links to Qatar the blockade was a shock to potteries and it was a very formative event for so many people living in the country it was a surprise they sort of woke up one morning and found that their land border their only land border with Saudi Arabia had been closed the gulf states that were blockading got that at the time were exhibiting a sense of resentment toward the fact that Qatar had achieved hosting duties for the World Cup this is symbolic or representative of some of the kind of deeper underlying issues and rivalries that have existed in this region for far longer than we've been talking about the FIFA World Cup the blockading Nations issue Qatar with a list of 13 demands including ending its alleged connections with terrorist groups all of them had to do with the country's foreign policy and the fact that sort of uniquely among the Gulf States it did not share the foreign policy of Saudi Arabia and the UAE the the two big heavyweights of the region and so the most obvious demand was a demand for author to cease its support for groups like the Muslim Brotherhood before political islamist groups across the region that have long been opposed to Saudi and the UAE the list also demanded Qatar sever ties with Iran a known antagonist of Saudi Arabia but with so much of the country's wealth tied up in the gas field it shares with the ram the state had little choice but to work around the blockade cutter for new trade routes mainly with turkey to redirect its Supply chains in some ways a kind of unintended consequence of the blockade was that it actually made the region less integrated and it made Potter far more self-sufficient in a way given the fact that it developed all of these other mechanisms on January 5th 2021 three and a half years after it started the blockade abruptly ended despite Qatar refusing to agree to any of the 13 demands when you ask people in the Gulf why they decided to end the blockade when they did last year you sort of hear different answers one of them is that some countries in the region came to a recognition that this wasn't working it exacted a huge diplomatic cost on them as well in the west there were a lot of countries that were upset about this and wanted the gulf countries to mend fences the World Cup was coming up and everyone else in the Gulf stands to benefit from the world cup from fans who might choose to base themselves in places like Dubai fans who might after going to matches and Doha want to be a tourist and go somewhere else in the region there was an economic benefit to be had and the gulf countries didn't want to lose out on that benefit by maintaining the blockade whether the conflict between the Gulf States will resume after the final whistle blows is unclear a lot of the underlying issues are still very much present whether we're talking about other major political disruptions regionally whether having to do with various other states in their region or the kind of ongoing standoff with Iran then of course some of these rivalries might might continue to kind of play out as they have before but the fact that those countries are now piggybacking on The Spoils of hosting a World Cup suggest Qatar already achieved some success they've acted a bit like a football team with a very wealthy owner who's willing to throw a lot of money at taking a shot on a star player not knowing exactly how that player is going to work out but being willing to make that effort with sort of the the world's most expensive bet on a football tournament if all goes well the joys of the month-long tournament will help Qatar build its image as a global sporting Hub but the criticisms it has faced mainly on human rights aren't going away hopefully even after the World Cup ends and the world's attention shifts to somewhere else that will not see a kind of backslide from addressing these issues in criticisms with the world focusing on the hosts and not just the football whether it's 300 billion dollar gamble will fully pay off remains to be seen it's a hard thing to say before the tournament uh what sort of Legacy it will be a lot of this depends on questions like did they overbuild you know all of these highways all of these hotels everything that has been built for this world cup doesn't find the use maybe it won't next year but will it find a use five years ten years hence will this all look like sort of one giant white elephant that maybe gave everyone a good show for a month but turned out to be tens of billions of dollars of wasted money from Father's perspective of course it has been very much folded into the idea of a kind of a massive National modernization plan maintaining its ability to not just Host this tournament but going forward to there's been talk of a future Olympic Bid And so there's a sense that but that is now known in a way that it certainly wasn't uh 10 or 12 years ago I'm

year's world cup has been a source of great controversy ever since and an alarmingly poor human rights record in the subsequent construction of eight new stadiums has only heightened misgivings uk newspaper the guardian reported in february 2021 that 6 500 migrant workers from india pakistan nepal bangladesh and sri lanka had died in qatar over the decade since it was awarded the tournament with many of these deaths said to have been related to working in extreme heat amnesty international has called it a world cup of shame and alleged there have been cases of forced labour and exploitation qatar refutes that and maintains significant progress has been made owing to a labor reform programme now migrants make up the vast majority of qatar's workforce and have been vital in building the eight stadiums and other facilities for the tournament with a population of less than three million qatar has long been reliant on foreign labour the working conditions and rights afforded to them have consistently created deep reservations the most vocal nation in opposition to a qatar world cup has been norway a group of top-flight norwegian clubs backed by their supporters

but the players from the national team have continued to make a stand they wore t-shirts carrying the slogan human rights on and off the pitch ahead of their first world cup qualifying game in march and during their last international break held up a banner that read fair play for migrant workers before facing the netherlands and they've not been alone norway's scandinavian neighbours denmark

their feelings clear in the spring german players lined up shoulder to shoulder before a qualifier against iceland wearing shirts printed with individual letters that spelt out human rights the dutch

there is yet to be any visible on-field protest by the english players even though amnesty international has urged them to join those teams demonstrating qatar though has always been able to rely on fifa for its support and that shows no signs of changing the game's world governing body in fact believes that taking the world cup to the tiny state has been an important catalyst for change there since the fifa world cup was awarded to qatar it has to be recognised that there's been significant progress in the matter of labour rights and standards in the country and these reforms go far wider than anything to do with football or the tournament fifa said in a statement given to the athletic in march qatar also says that it's done more to improve conditions for its workers than any other country in the arabian gulf region and contests the high estimates of worker deaths since construction began in 2014 there have been three work-related fatalities and 35 non-work-related deaths a spokesman for qatar supreme committee for delivery and legacy claimed in a march statement but while fifa's support of qatar has been unrelenting so has been the pressure from amnesty international

Connecticut with barely any soccer tradition and summer temperatures so punishing the tournament's date had to be moved we are here to announce the unsealing of charges and the arrest of individuals as part of our long-running investigation into bribery and corruption in the world of organized soccer and after a years-long investigation that led to the conviction of several soccer Executives in 2020 the Department of Justice explicitly accused Qatar of bribing FIFA officials to secure hosting rights however Qatar and FIFA denied the allegations and barreled on cutter had to build most of its World Cup infrastructure from scratch but these buildings didn't just spring up out of the desert over 2 million migrants came here mostly from Africa and South Asia to build all of it including most of the stadiums where the games will actually be played but according to numerous reports from Human Rights organizations the working conditions were Dreadful hotels public transportation highways had to be built in a time crunch and quickly the world's attention switched from bribery accusations to human rights violations ESPN's E60 documentary qatar's World Cup offers an incisive look early 2014 we went to Qatar see what life was like there for migrant workers this is a hard place to be conditions were appalling from 2009 to 2014 680 Nepali workers died in Qatar the deaths of most migrant workers are officially attributed to cardiac arrest foreign to his wife and son when he tried to switch jobs he says the company he was working for wouldn't allow it an investigation by the guardian found that over 6 500 migrant workers died in Qatar since 2012. 37 of those deaths directly linked to the construction of the stadiums While others suffered violence fans need to know how this came about that the stadiums that they're sitting in was built by workers and many of whom were in conditions of what we would call forced labor or other forms of modern slavery the Qatari government disputed that the deaths were work related but after these accusations were made public the labor laws were changed implementing labor courts where workers can bring cases against employers for mistreatment and the withholding of wages and the colonial era kafala system which gave employers significant control over migrant workers and their immigration status was abolished what attention if any have you paid to the surrounding controversy that keeps getting talked about we've spoke to a lot of Margaret so I've been here we see a lot of them and they all seem generally quite happy obviously it doesn't take away from the fact of what has happened it's a mixture it's tough you're trying to celebrate but at the same time you realize there's uh there's issues at stake here that are real other controversies and culture clashes persist the anticipated one million fans traveling here for the World Cup will be expected to abide by a strict dress code and fans learn just two days before the tournament that beer sales would be banned at all World Cup stadium sites though VIPs in corporate Suites would still have access to booze it was a shock but again we're in the culture where drinking isn't a thing and so I mean I think people need to embrace the culture as well but yeah I mean I'm disappointed this viral incident days before the the tournament highlighted qatar's struggle to assimilate the world media into its culture of a tightly controlled press so you're threatening Us by by Smashing the camera Qatari officials apologized after the incident while Qatar zamir has called the world's criticism an unprecedented campaign against the first Arab Nation to hold the tournament listen everybody's welcome in Doha we do not stop anybody from coming to the half with any different backgrounds any different belief Qatar is a very welcoming country we have millions of people that come and visit our country we welcome everybody but also we expect and we want people to respect our culture but not everyone feel was welcome in Qatar one of the biggest issues being that homosexuality is illegal in the Middle Eastern country qatar's Ambassador for the World Cup addressing the issue in an interview with German TV let's see to say about the gay everybody we will accept they come in here but they will accept they have to accept our rules this Haram because why is Haram I am not big one big Muslim but because they're damaging the mind there's concern about the country's treatment of lgbtqi residents and fans visiting the country and players are speaking up including the U.S men's team whose facility is decorated with a rainbow version of its team logo the slogan that we have within our in our team be the change we know that we're more than than athletes at the end of the day and we can have an impact that that lasts a lifetime and when you look at social injustice gun control and things like that we've been very vocal and outspoken against those things in our own country so I think for us it's bringing that here as well and bringing eyes and awareness to the situations that go on considering human rights and some European soccer federations had announced their intention for captains to wear an armband with a rainbow heart but then abandoned the idea after learning the captains would be given yellow cards if they took part in the initiative this FIFA World Cup last month FIFA president Johnny Infantino promised an inclusive World Cup but in an extraordinary press conference on the eve of the tournament he ignited a new controversy today I feel Qatari today I feel Arab today I feel gay today I feel a migrant worker I think for what we Europeans have been doing in the last 3000 years around the world we should be

several human rights and ethical issues. Despite the excitement surrounding the tournament, controversies loom. Qatar, with limited soccer tradition, won the hosting rights amid accusations of bribery and corruption within FIFA. Investigations by human rights organizations revealed appalling conditions for migrant workers predominantly from Africa and South Asia, tasked with building the tournament infrastructure. Reports suggest many workers faced conditions akin to forced labor, with numerous deaths linked to the infrastructure projects, claims which Qatar disputes. Under global pressure, Qatar reformed labor laws, abolishing the kafala system that restricted workers' freedoms. Despite these efforts, the handling of LGBTQ+ issues remains controversial, with homosexuality being illegal in Qatar. Officials stress cultural respect, posing challenges for LGBTQ+ fans and residents. FIFA faced criticism for not adequately addressing these concerns; for example, teams intending to wear rainbow armbands were threatened with yellow cards. The Qatari government faced additional backlash over a viral incident involving the local press's treatment of international media. In defense, the Qatari leadership claimed an unprecedented campaign of criticism against them, advocating for cultural respect. Despite the government’s expressed hospitality, fears remain about the safety and acceptance of diverse groups. As the event progresses, tensions between celebrating a global event and addressing significant social issues continue.",Human Rights Issues,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar

match at least possibly risking their lives back home where protests rage over the death of a young woman detained by the morality police Iranian State TV cut away from its live broadcast so divisive and so expensive there's never been a World Cup like this I'm Ben fazolin in Berlin with your DW business special joining me to Crunch the numbers and discuss the knock-on effects is David con investigations correspondent at the British newspaper the guardian he wrote a book about corruption at FIFA football's World governing body David just first off is there still corruption at FIFA um well it's it's very hard to know uh for sure because the nature of corruption is obviously that it happens behind closed doors but I think we do have to acknowledge that the corruption scandals led to many of the people at FIFA being arrested or banned from football and it is largely a new broom at FIFA and they have brought in more modern corporate cultures to try to address the corruption issues and I think the general assumption is that it's much less of a significant feature than it was before the arrests in 2015. well the corruption aside qatar's World Cup is the most expensive edition of the tournament we'll look at the figures later first the human costs rights groups say thousands of workers may have died on the huge construction sites the government calls the claims outrageous and offensive it's threatened to sue uh let's clear up that issue first of all with David because a lot of people are calling this the the world's deadliest major sporting event in history yeah and I think it can become quite distasteful and uncomfortable for there to be so many arguments about the figures for for deaths for people dying but it has come to that now a lot a lot of people's cite an article that was written in the guardian that has a figure of 6500 migrant workers dying um but that that article seems to have created the impression in people's minds that that was 6 500 people dying in the construction of World Cup stadiums but the article never said that it said that it was 6500 migrant workers from five different South Asian countries who had died in Qatar in I think the 10 years since the World Cup was awarded in in all different occupations and not related many many of them I think most of them to construction uh are not directly related to World Cup Construction in which the figures in that article are that there were 37 workers who died in the construction who worked on the construction of stadiums of which three were accidents in the construction one of whom was a British construction worker and 37 have died in what they call that non-work related deaths but this is the big issue for human rights groups not necessarily related to World Cup construction is just the Heat and the stress of the working conditions in the Gulf in that part of the world not just in Qatar and the countries have been built by the labor of workers brought in from very very poor countries mainly in South Asia so the human rights groups issue is that not enough is done to protect people from from the heat from the suffocating heat that in many of the months in the year it's really uh very very oppressive heat and you do have to be very careful of people's Health when they're working there so the broader issue of of worker treatment uh what can't be argued is this is the most expensive Edition by far the price tag is an unparalleled 220 billion dollars just uh look at the huge gap here previously the most pricey World Cups were Brazil 2014 and Russia 2018 which cost less than 15 billion Germany's 2006 cup cost just over 4 billion one of the world's wealthiest countries this is what Qatar spent building seven new stadiums and rebuilding another along with an entire metro Network it forked out even more on skyscrapers hotels highways universities museums and a port the country's been transformed literally from the outside at least David could that massive investment backfire on the Emirate considering all the controversy it's kicked off yeah I think again they would argue that um a lot of that spending is infrastructure spending as you say they've built a new Port they've built a Metro System they've built other as you say hotels um and and a lot of infrastructure um so they would say that that's General building of the country perhaps it's been accelerated by the fact that the World Cup was happening but where I think there's no doubt at all is that they just weren't equipped like a country such as Germany uh to host a World Cup in the sense of having stadiums they only had one stadium and even that had to be uh quite substantially refurbished or re-refigured reconfigured and then they've built seven you know as we're seeing in our television screens superb new brand new modern stadiums and it's very very hard to see any sort of after you any sort of Legacy for those stadiums in Qatar which is such a small country there were some promises when they bid for the World Cup when they got the vote in 2010 that they were going to dismantle some of the stadiums and and build them in other countries that could need them but I don't actually think we know what is going to happen to the stadiums but I think on The Wider implication of your question will it backfire because of the controversy it's very very interesting to see now that the tournament has started the action starts the fans are in the stadiums the broadcasters are all there the stadiums look fantastic all lit up broadcast around the world I think Qatar is this is what they've been building up to this is what they've spent the money for this is what they've survived and sustained all the controversy for because they want to be able to project these images of this is the country that has brought all these people together over an incredible event that you know people love around the world the World Cup and have come to Qatar and they want to show that they've organized it really well that the stadiums are incredible and this is part of their National projection their strategy for projecting their country around the world and it's Western allies are also keen on putting a positive spin on this world cup because of their relations with Qatar they're strengthening their alliances right now to cover their energy needs amid the crunch created by Russia uh what what do you think about how Western nations are responding to this world cup I think that's a very good question and I think that there this that does lead us into this Tangled contradictory um attitude that there is to it so I think in the commentary um there is so much uh criticism um of Qatar of its treatment of uh the migrant workers and quite rightly the human rights groups have absolutely um campaigned for better conditions uh against um elements of the working practices that are abusive um but at the same time and also lgbtq plus rights and so on and other issues of free speech obviously Qatar isn't a democracy just like the other countries in the Gulf but at the same time at exactly the same time um these countries are huge investors uh in Europe I mean they're huge investors in uh in the UK uh obviously um the ruler one of the ruling family of of Abu Dhabi owns Manchester City Football Club uh a Saudi Arabian Sovereign wealth fund owns Newcastle United Football Club now they own huge uh real estate in London uh and elsewhere in in the UK and um Qatar itself has signed a 10 billion pound investment deal I think this year or last year and the British government is continually looking to the gulf for investment particularly post-brexit so I think the qataris at times uh find themselves a bit baffled by quite how much Western and European governments are falling over themselves uh to ingratiate themselves with their country while at the same time there's so much media criticism of our of the country itself and conditions within it and then there's a big commercial aspect that's involved one of the major sponsors of Germany's World Cup squad in Qatar has ended its partnership with the German Football Association major German supermarket chain Rivas says it made the decision because the dfb capitulated to FIFA's threats to punish teams wearing the one love armband in protest against qatar's laws against homosexuality captains of several European teams had planned to wear it but backed down David how dire is it when sponsors start pulling out yeah I mean it's very rare that sponsors pull out and you know sponsors put up with an awful awful lot uh sponsors are concerned with their own brand image um and they get huge brand uh exposure and benefit from associating themselves with football and I think usually uh a criticism can go the other way which is that football is used to launder the images of the sponsors rather than that the sponsors are concerned that their image is going to be solid by its association with football I think the armband and the rainbow Flags yeah these are really unfortunate uh upsetting um things that have happened because we can all see that the armband and the rainbow that it's there to show solidarity with lgbtq plus people but also human Freedom the freedom to express yourself um it's a bit of a perennial issue because FIFA takes the position and it's not alone as a governing body of football and of sport that it tries to keep what it considers to be politics and I know you could argue that that is not a political gesture at all I'm not really defending what FIFA have said I'm just trying to explain that I think I think that the background to this and it's a very very long-standing position is that if they start to allow um the actual game itself on the pitch to be used for political gesture political demonstration then where would it end and some of the causes that some people or some players or some teams might want to espouse might be causes that we would find actually repugnant so they try to keep it as a neutral space and we've had examples in British football where players have wanted to show solidarity with different causes that most people would absolutely support and they've been disciplined for it but it but it's always really unattractive when it happens what about when the hordes of fans who are expected don't turn up or turn on their Tellies I know a lot of people boycotting the event Germany's World Cup winner Philip lamb said he wouldn't go well I think I mean I just don't feel that that's been a widespread reaction at all uh obviously there's not a single team that has boycotted and that's when it really has an impact and I think I think that the figures are that 97 of the seats are full and 97 of the tickets have been bought so for all the controversies and for all the criticism the put the whole point of why Qatar and other countries want to host a World Cup it is precisely because it is such a loved and special event that it would take something absolutely uh huge and obviously bigger than the criticism that had been of Qatar for a boycott to happen and for supporters in large numbers not to want to be there and I think that the perspective that I feel we should put on this as well is that the World Cup the last World Cup was held in Russia in 2018. Vladimir Putin had already shown his true colors he'd already annexed Crimea he'd already been oppressive uh in the Dom bass I think the world already knew exactly who he was and yet there really wasn't anywhere near as much controversy there it wasn't didn't face as many accusations of sports washing as this has but I think when we look back now and see how much it puffed up Vladimir Putin um and and just four years later he's waging this horrific war against his neighbor Ukraine I think we can see that that was a massive Sports washing event um and not um just to boost the image of the country but uh of you know a ruler of a country who really did does have murderous intent towards his neighbors David apart from Sports watching this world cup was built as environmentally sustainable despite having to air condition the stadiums I know a lot of high tech and low energy solutions were found but this was also meant to be a compact event the stadiums aren't too far apart but tens of thousands of foreign fans are using shuttle flights between Dubai and Doha due to a lack of accommodation High hotel prices and alcohol limits how would you judge the green washing going on uh maybe I'm going to give a surprising uh answer that might seem a bit tame but I just think that that's a symptom of the World At Large not grappling with the climate crisis it is hard for me to single out this event I mean every mega event uh was the Olympics in London in 2012 was that environmentally friendly or did it involve a lot of travel and construction that wasn't really necessary is the world just carrying on hosting events do we all of us not want to give up our way of life that was forged in a time when climate crisis wasn't as much of an issue so look it's not at all surprising is it that the hosting of a World Cup is not the most environmentally friendly activity um that we could be involved with and um you know I think any real Promises to the country were never really going to be um you know fully realized well it'd be nice to see future World Cups perhaps make more of an effort but David uh let me also bring up something you brought up earlier what happens once the World Cup is over are these wise Investments Sports tournaments are notorious for creating white elephants Dan Plumley specializes in sports finance and he points out that other more established footballing Nations then Qatar had that problem too issues with Brazil and South Africa so it is a risk and it's always a risk with any major sporting event I think some of the things that Qatar have tried to do are trying to be a little bit Innovative so that you know there's a stadium that's built from shipping containers that can be taken down and then reconstructed elsewhere but you always run the risk with a major sporting tournament that your stadiums are left unused when everyone's gone home and and I think that will still be a risk for Qatar especially given the domestic League system is not as advanced as other countries yet so yeah it will be a problem and but it's a problem with every sporting event as well so lastly David once the big event is over what sort of country will the people of Qatar be left with do you think well Qatar won the right to host the World Cup in 2010 12 years ago so we've all had a lot of time to think about what is this really for and what are they really after and I think talking to people and covering it myself I've come to the view that for the for this country hosting the World Cup is part of a project for National projection National the building of the country itself on the global stage and I think there's a very small country um population wise um that's run by an emir a ruler and I think that the emirs um Legacy that he is looking for his for Qatar to be much better known on the world stage and to have hosted an event that's brought people together successfully and he has been prepared or they have been prepared to sustain all the criticism and all the expense and they they're clearly prepared to sustain a number of stadiums that we cannot see how they can have any real after use um so I don't think it's that kind of Legacy in the normal way that in in Britain or in Germany people would be very very critical of white elephants of stadiums that didn't have an after use I think that that's built into the budget um and what the budget is paying for is the projection of Qatar on the world stage we're going into extra time David so we'll have to leave it there investigations correspondent at the guardian David Khan thanks for pitching in and from DW business I'm Ben fazulin whether or not you're watching this world cup do take care bye-bye thank you foreign,"The transcript discusses the multifaceted implications of hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, emphasizing various aspects such as sportswashing, human rights issues, and the financial ethics surrounding the event. The conversation begins by highlighting the human cost of the tournament, focusing on the conditions faced by migrant workers and the societal issues in Qatar, particularly concerning women's and LGBTQ rights. The banning of the ""One Love"" armbands and the response from Germany's national team are noted, showcasing international reactions against Qatar's laws. The transcript features a commentary from David Conn of The Guardian, who discusses FIFA's attempts to combat internal corruption and the broader discussions about Qatar's immense financial outlay for the tournament, estimated at $220 billion. The debate extends to the controversial worker death figures, often misinterpreted, and the ethical implications of labor conditions in Qatar.",Sportswashing,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar
RVvfAOqau8E,The Ugly Truth About Qatari Money! 🇶🇦,"Qatar is a tiny country about the size of the state of Delaware located in the Persian Gulf it has the fourth highest GDP per capita of Any Nation on Earth twice out of the USA and is still growing fast by 30% last year until last century though no real States existed in Arabia and the black liquid which spewed out of the ground was of little interest to the Western Powers which passed through the area Portugal came and left catar in the 16th century and while the small Pearl fishing and trading Outpost of Doha was sporadically occupied by the Ottomans and muskat for strategic reasons when the British arrived in 1916 the town which would one day become qatar's glittering Capital remained little more than a collection of tents accumulating under the fierce Arabian Sun under the British Qatar was finally structured into a recognizable State gaining independence in 1971 with the althani dynasty established as rulers to govern in accordance with the strict and auster principles of fundamentalist wahhabi Islam but then just before the British with gas was discovered under the desolate Sands but the althani dynasty would have to wait for another two decades before the technology became available to extract it and sell it abroad since that became possible however Qatar has gained more wealth than they are able to deal with by themselves the althani standard is now the flag of one of the richest Nations on Earth Qatari citizens pay no income tax and are given most of their Public Utilities such as water and electricity for free land is given to Qatari citizens for free and interest free loans are issued to build on it the Qatari government pays for their citizens Healthcare and education even when they go to study abroad but this is not the type of monarchy which exists in Britain the althani family and their favorites dominate nearly all of the senior executive positions of power in Qatar and continue to rule in accordance with the strict Islamic values which they do not share with the west or indeed with most of the people living in Qatar itself because today of the 2 and A2 million Qatari residents barely one in six are actually citizens in order to build their immense wealth Qatar have imported their Workforce as well as their commercial and social infrastructure of the workers who flock to Qatar some are impoverished manual laborers that the country needs to keep the roads working and the streets clean and some are skilled and Wealthy business owners but every Foreigner who sets up a business in Qatar must have a qari sponsor who receives a large cut of the profit without making any investment as obtaining qari citizenship is nearly impossible few in the country enjoy the full rights of citizens however as long as Qatar remain immensely wealthy eager for lucrative business and a major non-nato Ally Western governments corporations and Academia are happy to turn a blind eye to qatar's exploitative economic model the West its culture laws and its freedoms were formed over centuries of compromise and interplay between Civil Society religions markets and government forces but Qatari wealth is not built on this Foundation qatar's wealth bubbles out of the ground without commercial or political compromise to the hemony of one ruling family and their ideology of radical Islam if katar have enough money to buy their own political reality at home and abroad regardless of economic sense or productive capacity well then that's their problem our problem is that we sell it to them qatar's 10 billion pound London property Empire now includes the conort hotel clares herods 2 billion 95% stake in The Shard a quarter of the Central District of Mayfair and now known as little Doha and SES of London's dockland CBD in addition they have brought uh commercial infrastructure such as Barkley Sainsbury's and even Heathrow Airport totaling to about 40 billion of British assets and more property than the Duke of Westminster and even the British crown itself there's nothing necessarily wrong with this in itself we should be flattered that our culture institutions and brands are most valuable Commodities that the wealthiest Nations can get their hands on but we are about to learn a valuable lesson that when you don't stand up for your society today you will be forced to stand up for somebody else's Society tomorrow Qatari joint ventures with news networks universities governments and corporations are undermining our society with a hostile ideology which aims to destroy the very civilization which attracts qataris to our Shores in the first place qatar's statun media Network Al jazer has already been banned in Israel Saudi Arabia the UAE kuwa Jordan and Egypt for being sympathetic to qatar's radical associ Hamas the Muslim Brotherhood alqaeda and the Taliban but while other networks like Russia Today voice of Europe ra novosti is Vesta and rosis skaya gazetta have already been banned by the European Union for dissemination of misinformation Qatar have learned that with Western governments you can pay to play during the Iraq War Al jazer would hide their camera Crews next to roadside bombs as American soldiers drove by when the bombs were detonated the camera Crews would record the explosions and sometimes the faces and battered bodies of American soldiers all of which they broadcast so Al jaaz were directly collaborating with anti-us forces in the battlefield yet Al jaera have risen in prominence to become one of the largest news networks in the west and now they are collaborating with Northwest University in the USA to provide qari journalism students with American scholarships when does a global media Outlet become a global propaganda machine accusations are often made about the BBC the UK's National broadcaster for its editorial bias but at least the UK is a democracy with an established opposition and the BBC has a clear editorial line Al jazer on the other hand is curated entirely by one feudal government of radical Muslims looking to replace America's hegemony in the Middle East one of the great public relations victory of our times has been qatar's use of the left-wing calling cards such as the pride movement to secure the support of Western liberals for the Arab Spring the Muslim Brotherhood Al-Qaeda and Hamas Qatar uses its News Network abroad to support the very ideologies of in the west which it prohibits at home and when a network cynically produces two different narratives for two separate audiences you know that subversion and not truth is the highest priority naive westerners who repeat contradicted slogans like gays for Palestine show that qatar's strategy is working do we really want katar Haring gallal westerners into their ideological ranks of one of the most regressive regimes on Earth under the pretense of a social justice which they themselves don't believe in expressions of homosexuality or even solidarity with homosexuals are illegal in Qatar and considered a capital offense by many of qatar's ideological allies Western football teams have to cover up their solidarity rainbow Flags when they play a match in Doha so there is no doubt that Qatar promote the pride movement in the west precisely because they view it as socially destructive when Rolls-Royce started selling their cars abroad they remov their famous Spirit of ecstasy emblem from the cars they exported to the Muslim world because it depicts a naked world now you can remove the spirit of ecstasy from a Rolls-Royce and it's still a Rolls-Royce but you can't build a Rolls-Royce by sticking the spirit of ecstasy onto a Nissan Micra Qatar have understood what many westerners also believe that product symbols are often more valuable than the product itself and this makes University franchises the perfect vehicle for projecting Qatari ideology abroad Education City is a Qatari project to bring American universities to Qatar specifically St as part of the deal that those campuses must be capable of giving degrees from their parent universities back in America and the West Virginia Commonwealth Cornell Texas A&M Carnegie melon Georgetown Northwestern HC Paris and University College London are all franchising their credentials in Qatar but can their standards of Education ever be so high in a country which adheres to puran wahhabi Islam Qatar States these educational and research institutions have total academic and inter ual freedom but just as radicalism grows on Western campuses funded by qar academics at Education City have been censored for their portrayal of Qatari life love comes later a book written by an English professor in Education City was banned by the state of Qatar with no explanation Qatar have given $5.6 billion to 81 American universities since 2007 including Georgetown Carnegie melon Virginia Commonwealth Yale and Stanford Harvard have received $8 million since 2020 alone Texas A&M have received $44 million since 2015 Northwestern $600 million and Cornell $1.5 billion since 2015 and all while Al jazer provides positive coverage of students who openly back Hamas already Jewish students are being threatened and prescribed terrorist organizations are being celebrated on these us college campuses Harvard's president has had to resign over anti-Semitism instances of which are around three times higher at universities which receive Qatari funding than those which do not Qatar may be a country which can buy institutions but it is not yet a country which could build or maintain those institutions themselves don't slide into the Trap of believing that Qatari joint ventures are establishing the liberal Western consensus on Qatari Frontiers by giving Qatar Insider status on their own Outsider terms they are colonizing us and not the other way around our relationship with Qatar is becoming an Unholy Alliance of two types of radicalism the first is the type which stands for an ideology which will not compromise or surrender to anyone the second is the type which surrenders on all fronts to a tragic attempt to accommodate the first against his backdrop of our capitulation Qatar remain intent on using their wealth to secure their future Global position and replace the USA as the Strategic power broker in the Middle East having helped America to depose Saddam Hussein in Iraq and during the evacuation of Afghanistan that swept the Taliban back into Power Washington tenuously held on to the idea that Qatar is a major non NATO Ally of the west but Western claims to being in control of this strategic situation are looking a bit tenuous given that Qatar have friendly relations with Iran and Russia and actually host the Hamas leader Ishmael Han in Doha while sending Hammer $30 million a month America share the Alid Airbase the largest in the Middle East with the Qatari Air Force which contributes to around 60% of the cost of the basee now the West can tell itself that we benefit from these types of strategic IC cooperations but is Qatar paying for 60% of America's war against extremism in the Middle East or is the West paying for 40% of the extremists war against the West if Qatari money can buy domestic opposition to the allies of the USA while Qatar collaborates with the enemies of the USA on active warfronts and the two trillion American defense budget starts to look a little bit futile if evidence were ever needed that you cannot surrender on all fronts and yet remain politically neutral it is qatar's subversion of the European Union now remember around 2 and A2 million people live in Qatar but fewer than 300,000 of those residents are actual citizens most are foreign paid workers building the hotels airports and the infrastructure needed for qatar's long-term prosperity and these people have no rights to a share in the wealth that Qatar is generating in Europe This would constitute a human rights travesty and we boycott other nations for less but the Qatari government have discovered that they can bribe NGO and politicians with suitcases of cash to keep quiet about what is going on and maintain West support in the runup to the 2022 Qatar World Cup none other than the vice chairman of the European Parliament was leading the opposition to a resolution critical of human rights in Qatar and attempting to broker a deal with Doha that would allow its citizens to travel to the EU without a Visa I alone said that Qatar is a front runner in labor rights said Ava KY still some hair are calling to discriminate them they bully them and they accuse anyone that talks to them or engages with them of corruption shortly after she made this speech Kye received a text from qatar's NATO Envoy hi Eva wrote abdulaziz bin Ahmed al-mal in a WhatsApp message my dear my Ministry doesn't want paragraph a about the FIFA and Qatar please do your best to remove it via voting before 12:00 noon or during the voting please soon after Kylie was arrested while trying to hide a suitcase of cash in her Brussels flat cash which had been given to her lover by the Qatari government in order to manipulate the EU Parliament to overlook qatar's human rights record the pair had even written the Qatari Minister's speech that he gave to the European Parliament during this Qatar Gate scandal € 1.5 million EUR of cash was found in at least 20 raids on homes offices and hotel rooms across Belgium France and Italy lobbyists trade unionists NGO directors and political operators were receiving hundreds of thousands of Euros to encourage Europe's Most senior lawmakers to turn a blind eye to qatar's activities and promote its interests such was the keenness of European bureaucrats to win favor and money from Qatar that they even took advantage of Qatari ignorance of the EU systems of governance telling qari ministers that they could produce successful results in fields where in fact they had no influence at all it may seem that we are giving Qatar a mixed message by supporting them militarily and politically even as they support enemies of the west but these apparent contradictions sent a very clear message to Doha and its radical allies that we will allow anyone who can pay us to enjoy an alak cart relationship with the West because the West will no longer defend its own interests","The transcript offers a critical perspective on Qatar's geopolitical and financial maneuvers. It begins by discussing Qatar's transformation from a modest trading outpost under various foreign rules to one of the richest nations after the discovery and commercialization of oil and gas. The Al Thani dynasty's rule, marked by conservative Islamic principles, oversees a society where the majority of residents are foreign workers with limited rights, contrasting with the privileges enjoyed by Qatari citizens. Qatar's wealth and international influence are profound, with significant investments in Western properties and institutions, particularly in the UK and the US. The script suggests that Western nations often overlook Qatar's exploitative economic models and conservative ideology due to financial interests.",Geopolitical Influence,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar

especially good with numbers and accounting he first became involved in soccer coaching his kids teams people would say how did you get involved in soccer and he would say i used to be a coach but he forgot to tell people he used to coach elementary school kids he was never any kind of high level soccer coach here we are brazil versus mexico so stay with us all right don't leave don't change that dial and i think as he was coaching his kid's soccer team he started seeing there's this building market here he became more and more more involved in like the organization of soccer welcome to soccer act usa here we are now we're hearing it from the words of mr blazer that the size of the soccer ball of the mls is going to be this big that's right thank you chuck we have a sold out colosseum in the background you have los angeles in the early 90s the first international tournaments take place in the usa something he did for u.s soccer federation was to vastly increase the number of soccer tournaments as secretary general of concacaf the football association of north and central america chuck blaser invents the gold cup we bring the hottest soccer action let's kick it off with the most recent concacaf gold cup tournament in sunny california concacaf at that time was considered kind of a joke nobody heard of it but chuck saw that as another avenue and the crowd is going crazy the game was on he didn't pay much attention to it he never talked about teams he never talked about players he was really into the business of soccer and he was largely responsible for the explosion of soccer in north america wow that was hot stuff we love you thanks for watching that same year chuck blazer is welcomed onto fifa's board its executive committee i think they saw you know americans as being sort of entrepreneurial yeah marketers you know they know how to market the sport more successfully that's what they saw probably in chuck who exactly are the executive committee of fifa and what is their role uh executive committee fifa is like a board of directors they are members who are elected from each of the confederations forming a group of 24 men who deal with all of the issues of football anybody that meant anything in the world of soccer especially for those trying to get the world cup to their country he was treated like royalty 25 years later he wrote me a letter a real letter i mean with a stamp on it and everything i was like wow nobody does that and it was a letter basically summing up the last 25 years of his life um saying that he was now dining with kings and queens and that he was the secretary general of concacaf which i didn't know what that was so i wrote him back saying wow i'm i'm kind of sorry you're only a secretary and he says no no secretary is in like in the united nations and i went oh okay well that that's wonderful that's great you know congratulations he said when i come back in town maybe we could have lunch i thought okay i could do lunch i was a little scared but i said you know it's been 25 years everybody gets mellow and so i went to see him uh at trump tower so when i went to the apartment his uh personal assistant opened the door and she led me through out to the living room and i looked around and i was like where the heck is he and then i saw him in the corner huddled in a velour bathrobe just like hunched over looking up i said wow i said hello [Music] he said i have to tell you something i have been in love with you for over 25 years and i've never forgotten our relationship i i cried every time i went by your apartment i can't get over you and um i've made you a mixtape i've made you a burn cd with songs that i think will tell you how i feel and he hit play think of me think of me and it was a collection of songs from phantom of the opera [Music] all these incredibly wonderful romantic songs and at that point i had tears running down my face because i realized he'd gone to a lot of effort for he this please be with me please and i will love you and take care of you and i will care for your children as my own please you know let us recapture our our happiness the timing was perfect and the setup was perfect and i buckled and so we started our relationship from there [Music] he decided uh for our first trip to take me to madrid and where i saw my very first soccer game and i was so proud and i said this is my very first soccer game he said don't tell people that but it was it was amazing i've never seen people run so fast [Music] and he said to me at the time he said we will be treated like kings and queens i couldn't figure that one out i didn't know what fifa was i called it fifa at first they were a little standoffish because they didn't know how long i was going to be on the scene because he was going through quite a number of women but i had the best time with them they were so funny very serious type people but they could crack a good joke we couldn't sit down to dinner anywhere unless there was a three-piece uh string quartet or i mean it was just incredible meals there was the best wine entertainment executive committee were very most very old and in many cases not very fit that's not to be critical because people get old people look at me people get fat look at me most of the exco had been players or coaches or managers or something to do with with soccer chuck was actually the only one i think that never played recep letter what was your relationship i liked him too [Music] i mean i found him charming and uh he was always very nice to me he reminded me sort of like a as a swiss benny hill because he always had that little twinkle in his eye and he's just like your grandfather a secret payment of one million swiss francs from isl arrived by accident in fifa's bank account a lot of people would say there's uh another side to him i never saw that side i've heard about it you know that he controlled everything with an iron fist if it was an iron fist it was in a velvet glove and our sport you know it our sport gives this dramas drama in football he was very very good at keeping the family together the essence of our sport which is discipline respect and fair play is faith are inherently corrupt no sir i think individuals are at least twice a year all ex-corps members and their wives fly to switzerland they convene at fifa's modern headquarters in a boardroom three floors below the ground we would uh usually travel swiss air wonderful airline he would often stay up the entire time and then go right to fifa house i think that fifa is doing a really excellent job of promoting football around the world if i look back 10 years 20 years and see the progress we made i'm very proud of our accomplishments they put a lot of work into it spreading soccer throughout the world finding countries that needed support [Music] we'd be there for three or four or five days would there always be a dinner everything was impeccable staying at the bower lock they have the best muesli and chuck told me to eat as much as i possibly could because fifa was paying for breakfast they had this um sort of like a bank for all the members to go to in the hotel he would also pick up 20 000 every trip to zurich he would split the money up into two packs and take a hundred dollars out of each pack so it was 9 900 which is legal i would carry 99 and he would carry 99. that was done every single time where would this cash come from fifa i mean their finance department do you know if all of the exco members went through fifa and got cash oh yeah as far as i know everybody did it was the last stop you made before you went to the airport you'd go on and get your envelopes [Music] is [Music] [Music] trump tower has an incredible view his apartment was on the 49th floor and they were always wonderful toys he always had the coolest gadgets max was a blue and gold macaw people used to report having seen him in central park in new york going out for his sort of exercise but his exercise was on one of those segways and he would go around this enormous man with a parrot on his shoulder [Music] concacaf offices were the entire 17th floor of trump tower he decided that he was going to build an aviary in his office at a cost of 150 000 it was all marble floors all glass walls overlooked central park and fifth avenue he had his own flat screen tv max did that was usually turned to animal planet he charged everything to conquer cafe and that includes the rent for his apartment for his cats they were litter box challenged so to speak and then when this other apartment opened up he said we could put the cats in there any an apartment in trump tower just for two cats 5 500 a month [Music] to find the best possible world cup host each exco member visits all of the candidate countries this is a chance for hopeful bidders to make an impression on the fifa bosses i went to russia it was pretty amazing the day that chuck went in to see putin while his ministers are lined up in the hallway and they were all pushed aside so chuck come in and meet with mr putin and the first thing putin says to him is you look just like karl marx and chuck said i know because i got him to grow a beard because he had three chins she spent all this time shaving he had to shave twice a day and i went what a waste of time you know if you grow a beard it would look better you know and he went oh that's a good idea and putin gives him a high [Music] five england we just went to london queen elizabeth i got to meet her and she was amazing and it was just like oh how are you today lovely that you came i'm so happy you're here and hope you're enjoying your stay i mean just incredibly gracious on point and as just natural as your next door neighbor not at all what i expected a queen to be and i finished my drink and i'm standing with this empty glass and chuck says give me a glass and i thought he was going to put it on the bus tray and he takes it and he's got his glass and he puts them both into his pockets i'm like you cannot steal from the queen of england what are you doing it's like you don't that's so tacky because i want a souvenir [Music] i had been to qatar i was never terribly comfortable there because i'm used to being able to when i go to a city getting up in the morning and going taking a walk around the city and you can't do that there um first of all it's 120 degrees outside [Music] it was like we were the joke of the of the whole bidding team even people within fifa didn't take qatar seriously as they should have they don't even have a team they don't have stadiums they don't have anything but they have a lot of money we haven't been hamam i mean what better lobbyist one of the most powerful men in football mohammed binneman was qatar's top football official he was also very close to seth blatter he was going around spreading huge amounts of payments across so so many football officials to try and create a groundswell of support for the qatari bid when we went to muhammad's house the men and women were separated and the women were sent to the women's quarters so we were all gathered upstairs we had some mint tea and then we were brought down to eat separately we had just started the meal when we heard a clap and we were told we had the men were finished and we had to leave i'm still eating but it didn't matter when the men were ready you have to leave [Music] everyone's had their mind on winning this event making money and reputation and recognition any means possible was considered by any of them [Music] in january 2010 the african football union comes together in angola for its annual congress this year they've got a new benefactor at the cost of 2 million dollars qatar's world cup bid has become the exclusive sponsor of the meeting there were three of the fifa mexico members votes up for grab binham attended this conference though he's not related to african football federation one of the people from hamam's camp was um amudo diallo he was also working for the bed at this point it was quite late at night around 11 o'clock and i was called by my boss who told me that i needed to go translate one of the first xcode members came in it is diallo um then offered one million dollars for your federation there's kind of like a laugh like i mean like one million that's all diallo said oh 1.5 million we met with all three of the fifa mexico members that evening one following another and the same exact scenario the exact exchange the promise of 1.5 million dollars and the promise afterwards of support for the qatar 2022 bid it was very open on the table this is what we're giving you this is what we want yes no thank you goodbye so there was no doubt in your mind that this was an exchange 1.5 million dollars for a vote oh no there was no doubt we had all three members vote [Music] i think that we can trust every one of the members you know at the end of the day they're football people new zealand is home to the world's smallest football association oceania the sunday times has gotten wind that oceania's sole member of the exco has received generous offers of financial support [Music] we had two tip-offs about irregularities in the process and that people were offering incentives for people to vote and we went to people who'd been on the executive committee in previous hosting contests all those people told us there was only one way to win a world cup we had to pay bribes and we decided to go undercover we posed as lobbyists for a group of american companies who wanted to support the american bid we went as part of that work to go and see reynard tamari who was the oceana fifa executive committee voter there are only 24 fifa executive committee members and each vote is really really important and it would be very useful for us to know if any have offered to finance this uh project we talked about how his vote might be influenced if we were to give money to to oceana is it something say for example that that our consortium might be able to finance yeah this kind of thing i'm keen to discuss if i compare with the property coming from it's nothing nothing we are talking about 10 to 12 million when we showed this to fifa they suspended him um and he was suspended i think for a year so without a doubt we can trust them [Music] the week before the vote michelle platini receives an extraordinary invitation he's invited to lunch at the french presidential palace as head of uefa the european association platini's support is crucial in becoming host of the world cup i so a person who gave me very precise detail information on a meeting that had taken place at lunch time at the elysee palace at which were present the president of the french republic nicolas sarkozy one of the guests was misha platini of course the vice president of fifa and president of uefa at the time but also two very high-ranking representatives of of qatar one of whom is the current emir victor and it was quite clear i mean the way that the person who told me about that this these are his words not mine he basically said you're president i stole this guy to vote for these guys if he wants to sell his planes [Music] so okay michelle platini is a very good friend has known mr sarkozy for a very long time and actually i think nobody in france doubts the fact that there was direct political pressure he had been made to understand that it would be a very good idea to vote for these people rather than to vote for the americans to whom it promised is his vote hello everybody i want to thank president blatter and all the members of the fifa executive committee for allowing me to speak with you today together you've given the american people an extraordinary opportunity to welcome the world to our shores as host of the 2022 fifa world cup you know we hadn't had a world cup since the 90s so it was our turn we would have heard rumors about you know bribes and stuff but i wasn't too worried i just knew i knew what the big book said and i knew who should be getting this december 2nd 2010. how do you remember that day it was one of the busiest days i ever had at fifa david how are you feeling just a couple of hours to go david we're happy and we're ready for our presentation we had heads of state we had a large number of uh very high profile figures international figures coming for the presentations because each bidding country want to be in their best possible image how are you feeling well we got a great bid so we just got to go in there and give it everything that we've got we had uh you know former president bill clinton we had the english prime minister at the time we had members of the royal family so it was extremely busy extremely colorful extremely high profile different groups you know they were up for the bid they're all huddled secretly and uh everyone's very nervous what do you think our chances are you think we can do this you think we're gonna win a warm welcome together with my executive committee finally the elective college of the world cup the fifa's world cup to those of you whom i had the pleasure of meeting in south africa it's good to see you again and i hope your time will permit we had a tight timetable about 15 minutes between beach bid committee's presentation thank you very much someone from fifa asked me to ask michelle platini who was deep in conversation with zindan and said would you mind gentlemen taking a conversation outside the committee room so the next bid committee can prepare it so well michelle petey was extremely annoyed to be asked to to leave the room and uh and looked at me in the most aggressive manner zindan zindan was a consultant to the uh the qatar bid and the world cup in qatar will send an important message to this football obsessed region the clincher i think was the sheikah from qatar she was impressive president platter members of the executive committee when when do you think it is the right time for this to come to the middle east and then she took a step forward and said it louder when the time has come the time is now thank you very much [Applause] chuck was brought in with the other exco members ahead of us and they were sequestered in the like where they were voting when they finally let us go into the room as i walk in this big auditorium i see chuck sitting there and i look at him and he looks at me and he doesn't look happy and i'm thinking oh this isn't going to be good and i had my camera so i took this picture they made me walk past him i wasn't allowed to speak to him made me walk past him to where the wives were sitting i could speak more and more but i have this comments and this is the couverier and then they start the process and sep gets up and he opens the envelope the winner to organize the 222 fifa world cup is qatar and a reason operation explosion firmly qataris jumped up and were you know all excited the rest of the audience i think was in shock there were loads of rumors of bribery floating about before the vote and the result of it when people were looking at each other so why would anybody in their right minds choose qatar bill clinton who was in zurich for the vote he went back to his hotel room and smash the mirror with an ashtray misha platini as he confirmed later i had actually told the americans that he would support their vote he and franz beckenbauer were the two fabulous footballers who had great knowledge of the game um it seems inconceivable that someone with such a knowledge of the game would want the world cup to be played in such searing heat as qatar platini must have had another reason for voting for qatar and which is when i think the real troubles of fifa started it was all because of that decision [Music] alongside me today is marilyn blanks who'll assist with the draw thank you italo the preliminary round and group stage of the champions league produced 63 hard-fought games between 24 teams from 13 different countries throughout the concacaf region the relationship had deteriorated over time um where he had gotten more abusive psychologically when i was with him i was very restricted as to my friends he was always around me he's always telling me what to do even the color of my hair the type of clothes i wore everything was controlled by him so when i was on my own i was like oh my gosh what should i wear today i i had gotten to the point where i was almost dependent on him telling me what i should be doing [Music] i was like how the hell did i get here mary lynn please pull a ball from the group winner's pot he was more distant and uh despite swearing his love for me um he still had quite a few girlfriends on the side and i had assumed that he would get rid of them when i arrived but that was not the case so i called him on it and um he got very angry one night one thing led to another and i was i was taking a bubble bath when he tried to smash the door down i was panicked i was terrified because i had been beaten up by him before but i still wanted to make it work i thought i could make it work [Music] people were peaked people were angry and people became very curious it attracted the press hounds who thought there was really something very very fishy going on i was in contact with two of the main sponsors in fifa and they told us we trust you but please bring back this boat of fifa in i would say in better waters we are not in a crisis we are only in some difficulties and these difficulties will be solved will be solved inside our family they felt like they needed an independent body to come in as a sheriff if you will the new investigator was a man called michael garcia garcia came up with a very very strong reputation today an indictment was unsealed in federal court charging 32 members of one of new york's most notorious crime organizations the genovese family of la casa nostra we're talking about one of the top investigators on the planet he got really interested in the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 world cups he was like a dog with a bone i think michael garcia went further than perhaps he was wanted to go michael garcia after two years wrote a very long report and he submitted it to um fifa and the reaction was nobody in the world would be allowed to see michael garcia's report we have listen to english the decision not to release report was the xcode's decision it's hardly in the interest of the executive committee to publish a report that is filled with allegations against themselves exactly and that's why they didn't uh this is i believe a very comprehensive report it's a very detailed report the more uh that is public and the more that people can see what is done and agree with what was done or disagree with what was done then that those issues can be resolved and the organization can move on and it was only under a lot of pressure that fifa decided to write a cut down version of the the garcia report which blatter was spinning telling everybody was was great because it had cleared qatar of any wrongdoing and the minute garcia i got hold of this resume he slammed the door and said i don't want to have anything to do with these people anymore it was all a bit of a disaster for fifa [Music] 2016. fifa had always had a history of being able to control their destiny where is my security command [Music] eventually they thought that it wouldn't hurt them here we go seth [Music] do you prefer that i go to texan english or to the oxford english or just my valles berke english when you opened the envelope did you know that qatar had won yes i i knew it because and i tell you it would have been another verdict we wouldn't have all these big problems we are facing now there was at this political intervention by a french state president and then things have changed michel platini had informed you did he explain why the president of france was telling him to vote for qatar no according to platini himself he felt a subliminal pressure during lunch with the french president and the emir of qatar and in the years since the relationship between france and qatar has only grown warmer i have been told that the qataris told uh sarkozy if you want to sell your airplanes tell this guy to vote for us i don't know if it was the rafale so the aircraft jets you know for the military or the airbus because you know qatar bought a lot of airbus [Music] finally the bot boss [Music] we are just one week 10 days before the final attribution so all the members of the family they came at the elysee palace the relationship between qatar and france and french football in particular flourished after this they took control of uh paris saja in 2011 they started to invest huge amounts of money in this particular club they also invested an absolute fortune in putting together a new tv network which in many ways gave french professional football the oxygen it so desperately needed because it was running out of money basically you know at the time they were buying they have more than 50 50 billion of dollars of exceed in their budget so when the emmy wake up the morning when he shave he said what what would what what will i buy today a team a hotel a company all the big companies the french big company of the infrastructure they are in qatar they are building the tramway the metro so for us it's also a big contract this is the pivotal moment when the europeans switch their allegiance from the americans to the qataris so you can see how in terms of macroeconomics and geopolitics the whole thing has worked if we look at what happened after the vote for qatar there's a pattern of qatar investing heavily in france after sarkozy in the vote what's the difference then between political interfering and buying the world cup a vote for the world cup is not made by buying uh votes it is the political interference it is not the same that an individual is going to a man and give him a hundred thousand of whatever uh the uh whatever gifts he gave him to vote that's not that's a difference the sunday times is now alleging it has evidence beyond doubt the proof's cutter bribed its way to winning the right to stage the tournament in 2022. millions of secret documents leaked to the sunday times bank statements letters emails by muhammad bin to ham support and influence with football officials around the world what we could see in the documents that was that mohammed bin imam has paid tamari a bribe which made sure that a vote against qatar didn't go ahead when i read that particular piece i thought this is unbelievable stuff if this is true this is the smoking gun are you pleased at what the sunday times did in uncovering corruption inside your organization inside fifa no i i'm not pleased about that but it gives us the opportunity to clean a little bit whatever has to be cleaned the part of the gazette report that i found most interesting was the part about reynold tsumari mr binham has paid to maori he's bought a vote would you agree i i don't agree with you because i don't know the story i know nothing about that i just learned it now it's in joe jekyll's summary of garcia's report the vote was rigged whichever way you look at it the vote was rigged directly but for some reason people are choosing to ignore what has been put in front of them definitely i've not studied the report i have surely seen it but i have not studied the report nobody put something for the president you should know that [Music] i'm determining at this point in time whether i wanted to remain with fifa [Music] i was concerned about endemic problems and vulnerabilities to greed-based corruption in the organisation for my own professional interest i assessed each then member of the executive committee on an integrity meter i concluded that a significant number of executive committee members had serious issues of integrity to such an extent that i decided that i could no longer work for fifa and reside okay i was interested in the truth being arrived at in fifa and the fbi provided one of the best mechanisms to arrive at that truth i went to the usa and and i met with several fbi officers who are dealing with this area i help them understand the nature of the organization that they were investigating [Music] you see the whole house of cards is falling all i did was tell them where the house was vulnerable [Music] that day when we were coming out of trump tower and we heard the voice behind us may we have a word with you mr blazer i knew that was it because nobody ever called him mr blazer he looked at me and he said mary lynn go to the restaurant i'll see you later they took him into the atrium and that's where they cut the deal he showed up 45 minutes later and then we had dinner it was a very tense dinner and then we went back to trump and once upstairs he told me they've got me for rico so what do you mean rico rico rico why do i know that you know i said that's like from the mob like capone and stuff and he goes exactly and i said but that means you're a crook and he was yes chuck for years had been doing this and he hadn't been paying tax and i i freaked i was like what do you mean you didn't pay your taxes how can you not pay taxes everybody pays taxes somehow he had slipped under the radar he was never on the salary of conica calf so every every check was made out to his offshore account which is how he dodged the irs never got a statement for his salary the allegations against chuck blaze were that whatever he negotiated he took his 10 so when the fbi started to investigate fifa he was obviously he was an obvious weak point so you have a choice you could spend the rest of your life in jail or you talk he was to wear wire and meet with various people in person or um on the phone and the phones were tapped and he was to elicit information from them to to expose the bribes and i begged him not to do it i said please find another way don't do this to these people [Music] i consider them my family and i said if you do this you're going to put all these people in jail and now i understand that there was corruption involved and stuff but from my point of view they were my friends i babysat their children i said please don't do this i declare open the games of london soccer is part of the olympics and so therefore all these people would be there so it was more like a social thing it wasn't the pressure that you have at the world cup was much freer he wrote out letters to everybody saying oh i'd love to have dinner with you in london and it was sort of to lure them in he was a good fellow he liked life he liked the restaurant he liked ladies chuck who was everybody's best friend had access to everybody because of his you know um he's being part of the fifa executive committee he could go to people and um lead the conversation onto quite a delicate terrain and then record it and people would perhaps start to sing so this was a list of people who would be secretly taped by by chuck blazer at the 2012 olympics in london at the mayfair hotel including a sep ladder and it was a one-stop shopping for for the feds and so it just began they had a minivan and he would go into the van he told me and they would hook them up with wires [Music] chuck was fitted with this this key holder which had a microphone they told him throw it on the table when you go to dinner with people and he went ah that's so blue collar i would never throw my keys on the table and they went just do it [Music] he was in a hidden agent he was wired he was fired he had a series of meetings where he recorded them with his key fob on a restaurant or a bar tabletop it's not only non-respect to fifa for football but it's a non-respect of the ioc and the organization of the games in in london to do her majesty the queen finally [Applause] yeah i mean fifa is like the sopranos but with worse people so it's the typical fbi technique [Music] i knew i had to get out but i didn't know how once he was away because he was away at the olympics for some six weeks i had breathing room as the weeks went by i went oh yeah i don't really like wearing this i don't want to wear that color nail polish anymore and i started thinking on my own but it took distance for me to be able to do that i was afraid to leave him while he was in town because i had been beaten up by him before and then when he came back and said he was going off the bahamas i said okay go and that's when i decided i would make my move and i did think of me think of me fondly when we've said goodbye remember me once in a while please promise me six top football officials have been arrested over corruption charges at football's world governing body fifa allegations of payoffs to the officials who decided where to hold the next two soccer world cup one u.s official charles blazer reportedly wore an undercover water 27th of may at 2015 this was for me like earthquake you know or a bomb coming on me bower lock is like a fortress so the idea that they were able to get in there and arrest those people was that blew my mind the wives were in the lobby crying my girlfriends they're crying and there's nothing anybody could do did you know that this was the result of chuck's work oh yeah he was their star witness it had to be all him he knew how everything worked and he told him [Music] they were expected to uphold the rules that keep soccer honest and to protect the integrity of the game instead they corrupted the business of worldwide soccer to serve their interests and to enrich themselves i could never understand the activity in switzerland with the american police intervening in my country why the hell they were at a sudden so much interested in football because they have not been given the world cup 2022. do you think that qatar should get to keep its world cup based on its bidding history i think they didn't do it any differently than anyone else after his stint as an fbi informant chuck blazer gets his day in court in his confession blazer describes how members of the exco took bribes when selecting france and south africa as hosts of the world cups in 1998 and 2010 shortly after dash beagle reveals how germany became host of the 2006 world cup we know now that germany also in 2006 there were tribes involved it's not qatar that made the rules i think it's fifa that made the rules and qatar just played by those rules when fifa started over a hundred years ago it was populated by a small number of volunteers who loved the game it's only the past 15 years where fifa began to realize enormous sums of money to make money and to spend money to bring soccer to places where it doesn't exist that was the idea of fifa verden smith namely fifa presidency suspended once they saw hundreds of millions tens hundreds billions of dollars coming in they were blinded by the lure of greed how much do they really believe in the sport if they pocket half of the income you know these kids who don't have a soccer ball to play with because chuck blazer wants to spend an extra 500. do you look back on it with regret i don't regret the adventures i was so honored to to have those moments and i will treasure them forever i don't regret that at all i just wish i'd been with a nicer man i got into the relationship thinking this was the love of my life and that i was going to reclaim this awesome relationship and it was never that i was the front it is inescapable that fifa must rebuild itself or it will die [Music] in the history of 114 years of fifa is perhaps the most important day [Music] a lot of people want to look at the election today as a new beginning when you speak about fifa you don't speak about football anymore and we have to bring back football ladies and gentlemen the election of the ninth president of fifa gianni infantino you will be proud of fifa you will be proud of what fifa will do for football we enter now into a new era of course the world cup will take place in qatar in 2022 there has been a lot of allegations i have not seen one single fact i think we have to move on the best [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you,"The transcript primarily revolves around Chuck Blazer's role and influence within FIFA, touching on issues of corruption, bribery, and the controversial awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. It begins with a reflective and personal narrative about Blazer's relationships, both personal and professional, painting a picture of the inner workings of FIFA, where corruption was rampant. The discussions spotlight various key figures, including Sepp Blatter, Michel Platini, and Mohammed bin Hammam, highlighting their involvement in and responses to allegations of bribery surrounding World Cup bids, particularly Qatar's successful bid. The narrative underscores Blazer's transformation from a soccer organizer to a powerful influencer within FIFA, who later became an informant for the FBI, revealing deep-seated corruption. The transcript touches upon the broader geopolitical influence and business dealings involving FIFA, including significant pressure from state leaders like Sarkozy, which allegedly influenced the voting process. It covers the fallout from these revelations, leading to arrests and an ongoing struggle to clean FIFA's image.",Sportswashing,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar
ejd7Zmz1r64,Qatar - In the spotlight of the World Cup | DW Documentary,"Every morning here in Qatar, camels
are taken out for their daily exercise. The small Gulf emirate
on the northeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula
prizes its traditions. These men are not Qataris. They come from
Oman or Saudi Arabia. Up until the past
two generations, the Qataris were
themselves desert nomads. Now their country is
wealthy, and most Qataris aren’t willing to do jobs
seen as more menial. During the 1990s, Qatar rose to
become one of the wealthiest countries in the world, thanks to its oil
and gas reserves. In the last 30 years,
it has developed faster than any other
country on the planet. A glittering, ultramodern world
has emerged from the desert. Qatar is currently
hosting one of the world’s biggest and most
prestigious sports events the men’s soccer world cup. It generates record
income in television rights and is a huge money
spinner for FIFA, football’s world governing body. The World Cup final is
watched by a Billion people, that’s more than one tenth
of the global population. The Corniche is the waterfront
promenade in the capital Doha. When I arrived here at the
beginning of October the countdown for the World Cup was already on although the temperature was
still around 40 degrees Celsius. I found the hot, humid
conditions difficult to cope with. But for the migrant
workers charged with getting everything
ready in and around Doha, the conditions were
now relatively pleasant. In the summer, Qatar sees temperatures
of 50 degrees Celsius or more. Heat-related accidents and
illness are not uncommon, and can range from
fainting to strokes, organ failure and death. Following international
pressure, Qatar has taken action. In summer, laborers
are no longer allowed to work outside during
the hottest part of the day. Climate now is good climate now. And in summer? Before, summer, too much problem And in summer
you’re working also? Yes, working. In summer when it’s really hot? Hot, but summer three
month...half night, half day. 12 o’clock, three
o’clock stop, nobody
working here. Now sometime the
climate will be change here, since September 1 now,
they will change our duty. Depend upon our climate. Now for three
months from June 1st they will change our duty
timing, for three month. After that they will
decide how is climate here, after that they will change. They come from poorer countries
like India, Pakistan, or Bangladesh. Qatar’s population is
just under three million of which two and a half
million are migrant workers! That’s almost 90 percent of
the population, a world record. These laborers earn
less than 28 euros a day. You get accommodation
and food from the company? Yeah, yeah, from the company. And you share a
room with others? Yes. How many people are in one room? Six, eight people And how much is it for a room,
how much money for a room? This on company. The company pays for it? Yes. The laws designed to protect laborers
in the heat were recently expanded. The ban on outdoor work
now goes from 10am till 3:30pm. Qatar is ready. Since 2010, when the Gulf
state was controversially chosen to host the World Cup, preparations
here have been underway. Seven new stadiums were built. The Lusail Stadium is the
biggest, seating 80,000 people. It took five and a half years to build
and cost nearly 700 Million euros. The World Cup organizing
committee has invited well networked young people from around the world
to serve as so-called “Fan Leaders”. It’s their job to help
fans from their respective home countries
arriving in Qatar. The fan leader program was
started from two years ago, where Supreme Committee
were collecting the people from around the world. And they start to give
them educated workshop, how they can manage the crowd, how they can talk to the media, what they want them to bring
from Qatar to the rest of the world. I have one friend that say, Oh I save money to buy one
car, I am working for four years but I will spend all my
money for the flight tickets! Welcome to Qatar! The Qataris are especially
proud of the 974 Stadium. It was built out of recycled
shipping containers, in a nod to sustainability
and innovation. It will host six group matches
and one match in the round of 16. The modular design with containers and prefabricated
sections rather like Lego pieces meant the stadium was
relatively cheap and quick to build. This venue is due to be dismantled
straight after the World Cup and the land used
for other purposes. Many are already
questioning how building an entire stadium for just 7 matches
can be described as sustainable. The whir of air conditioning
systems is audible everywhere. Even in the fall, with temperatures
around 40 degrees Celsius, the grass needs special care. Huge fans help to cool
the air to improve growth. But this stadium
has no outdoor AC unlike the other venues that have
to be kept cool all the year round. Mohammed Al Atwaan is
the stadium’s facility manager. He’s a Qatari, easily
recognizable from the traditional clothing
that all Qatari men wear. We used 974 containers in total, that’s why even the name of
the stadium is Stadium 974. And it represents the
international dialing code of Qatar as a sign that
Qatar is welcoming communication and welcoming
everyone to join us in the first Middle Eastern,
Arab, World Cup. What will happen to the
containers afterwards? We have the flexibility
in the design to repurpose or recycle most of the
components so those containers can be used to build the same
stadium with the same capacity in a different
location in the world in Qatar or a different
country in the world, with the same capacity
as 40,000 seats. Or we can build smaller
venues with a smaller capacity, so we can build 20,000 seats two venues in
different locations. The World Cup mascot marks
the way to the next venue. The Al-Janoub Stadium
was designed by Iraqi-British female architect Zaha Hadid. It took five years to build and
cost almost 600 Million euros. We filmed workers
on the glistening roof, until an angry security guard
ordered us to switch off our cameras, even though it’s a public area. It was the third time
we’d been stopped by security and
prevented from working. German journalist and
Qatar analyst Florian Bauer knows all too well what
happens if Western journalists try to report on things that Qatar’s
secret service deems off limits. When he went to a district
known as the Industrial Area, to film the conditions that
millions of migrant workers are living in, he was arrested. The police, the military, and
the secret service all came, and they interrogated
us for 14 hours. At 4 o’clock in the morning, we
were released by the public prosecutor. When we asked if we could
leave the country, we were told no, not at the moment. The public prosecutor even told
us that he had no say in it anymore, it was the secret service,
and if they don’t want you to leave then you won’t get out. And what’s your trip
been like this time? You can see the
Qataris are very cautious. They keep trying to caution
us and even influence our reporting to
a certain extent. Just today we were in
the Industrial Area again and we had a car follow us,
which I’ve never experienced. It was a white four-wheel
drive with a Qatari man. It’s clear we were being
monitored by the secret service. It sheds a bad
light on the country, at a time when it
ought to be more open. I think they
should just say We’ve tried to
change a lot, in some areas we’ve been
successful, and others not. And that’s understandable. I’ve never known a country
to advance so quickly as Qatar has in
the past 12 years. And I think the Qataris
would do well to highlight that in their media campaign. The Emir of Qatar,
Tamim bin Hamad al Thani, and his father, the former
Emir, Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani, have led Qatar
into the modern age, using the profits
from oil and gas. And they haven’t only
focused on the economy. The state-owned news network
Al Jazeera, modelled on the BBC, has been something of a
revolution for the Arab world. It was the first Arabic
broadcaster to air not just government spokesmen
but alternative views as well. The opening of Western
universities is also part of Qatar’s modernization plan. I’ve come to the renowned American
Georgetown University in Doha. Here I meet Gerd Nonneman, a Professor of International
Relations and Gulf Studies. He’s lived and worked
here for more than a decade and is well acquainted
with Qatar’s political vision. While staging the World Cup in
the desert seems absurd to many, he says for the Qataris
it makes perfect sense. The basic idea was always that
this was going to bring visibility and a measure of soft power, by persuading the world that Qatar is not just about
camels and sand and oil. But also, the key
aim was to make this part of their
developmental strategy, the strategy for
long-term development. So, the World Cup
was one of those things that fits
in that strategy. So, it’s both a
question about visibility and long-term
economic development. That development
is visible everywhere. Areas that were just
desert back in the 1980s now boast skyscrapers,
office towers and luxury hotels. The futuristic skyline has all
developed in the last 30 years. Society has also changed and not all Qataris
are happy about it. Some parts of society
this has gone very fast. Some people have
felt very uncomfortable with literally everything’s
changing in two generations. But again, the top of the
ruling family have been on the one hand very
clear where they want to go which is modernize without
losing authenticity and identity but on the other hand
they’ve implemented it in ways that try to
bring in consensus. Although some people are unhappy,
Qatar’s emirs have won over many, with state benefits
that are second to none. Qatari citizens receive
generous allowances and salaries. Education and excellent health
care are all provided for free, and there are no taxes. I’ve arranged to meet Maria again,
the Fan Leader from Argentina. She’s lived in
Doha for eight years and works for a company that
helps South American businesses who are looking to
gain a foothold in Qatar. She says Argentinians
both here and back home are very excited
about the World Cup. Right now we are over 600, 700
that we are living here in Qatar. And we are expecting more
than 70,000 Argentinians. Yeah it will be crazy! What will you say to the Argentinian
fans when they come over? First if they can read a
bit or if they can be in touch with someone
that is living here, it’s nice to know a
bit about the culture it’s different to our
culture of course. We have like a dress
code here in Qatar and you should cover
your shoulders and knees. But it’s not everywhere if you see we are
here in the Corniche, you will see men or women
with shorts or without sleeves. And of course, with alcohol,
they will not be able to buy alcohol at the supermarket, but they can drink a
beer or any alcoholic drink in bars or pubs and
even in the fan zones, in some of them, they will find. So, I think it will be fine. And do you think there could be
problems with unmarried couples? No. Here in Qatar no one
asks you about anything. Well I’m married, but if I want to go to a hotel
and book a room with a friend, I can do it, they will not
request a marriage certificate. And for the World Cup I’m
sure they will not request it. Foreign tourists may
not face such questions, but a Qatari woman
certainly would. Sexual relations outside of
marriage are banned for women. If an unmarried
woman gets pregnant, she will not only be ostracized,
she’s likely to end up in prison. And she can’t access
medical care either. If a woman goes to check up
on pregnancy issues and so on, you have to be married. So that’s true. That’s absolutely true,
so that’s problematic. If you deliver a baby,
again if you aren’t married, if you can’t show you’re
married, then you’re in trouble. And these are things
that are problematic, and that stem really
from a society that is still in large parts pretty
conservative about these kind of moral,
gender questions and so on. And this is not just
true for Qatari women, this is true for anybody. So that’s why you hear these
stories about sometimes domestic staff that have a relationship or
whatever, and they’re in trouble. It’s not as if they’re
going to get mistreated, but they will often be arrested
and have to be detained. Women are second
class citizens in Qatar, and subject to
their male relatives. They’re not free to make
decisions about their own lives. Whether they want to
marry, study, work or travel they’re dependent
on the goodwill of their father,
husband or brother. There are some limitations. There are official limitations
on travel under a certain age. You have to have permission from a
male figure of authority in the family. If you are a Qatari woman
and you marry a non-Qatari, then your children will
not get all the benefits of a Qatari citizenship
for instance. Whereas if you’re a Qatari man
and you marry a foreign woman, then your children
will have citizenship. So, these are
the sorts of things that you find a lot of
young Qatari women and not just young Qatari women agitating about, publicly. It’s also a subject of
debate in “Education City”, a vast campus linked by tram that includes satellite
institutes of renowned US, French and
British universities. Seventy percent of the
students in Doha are women. Unlike the men, most wouldn’t
be allowed to study abroad. There’s growing opposition
here to the practice of male guardianship over
women, and the fact that Qatari men can still have four
wives at the same time. The former Emir, for example,
has three wives and 27 children. But not a single Qatari
woman was willing, or perhaps allowed, to
speak to us on camera. I’ve come to Qatar's
National Museum, which boasts
impressive architecture. It takes visitors on a
journey through the history of the small desert state. Until the 1930s,
the pearl trade was Qatar's biggest
source of income. Britain’s Queen Elizabeth
was later given a pearl necklace when she visited Qatar. The decline of the pearl
industry was followed by a period in the 1940s
known as the 'years of hunger'. But in the 1950s, Qatar began
producing oil on a significant scale. Then in the 1970s,
the world’s largest natural gas field
was discovered, most of it in Qatar’s
territorial waters. And from the mid-nineties,
Qatar began selling liquified natural gas
all over the world. It was the income from
that gas that financed Qatar’s unprecedented
modernization drive under the leadership
of then Emir Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani. He was also the one in 2010
who saw Qatar awarded hosting rights for the World Cup. His son, the current Emir,
Tamim bin Hamad al Thani, has continued his policies. But he came under pressure
when rival Arab states slapped a blockade on
Qatar that lasted several years. We don’t accept anybody
interfering in our sovereignty. Our sovereignty is a red line. To safeguard that
sovereignty, Qatar has excelled in networking and become
an international mediator. Doha’s Sheraton Hotel
has served repeatedly as a venue for talks between
various warring parties. From the U.S. to the
Taliban, Qatar has made its foreign policy as
broad as possible. The strategy is first of
all complete pragmatism. There’s no ideological
element to this. It’s been a decision
right from the beginning let’s say the early 90s onwards when Sheikh Hamad they call him Father Emir,
the father of the current Emir set out to secure Qatar’s
visibility and security, anchored of course in the
prime security guarantor, the United States, whom they gave this huge airbase Al Udeid Air Base. So they became
very useful for the US, when they want to talk to Iran, very useful to the US also when
they wanted some place to connect to, to send messages to, and ultimately have
conversations with the Taliban. So Qatar then responds and says fine, they can come
and set up an office here, and you guys can
meet each other. Each week, men flock to the national
Grand Mosque for Friday prayers. The emir also prays here; accessing the building via
his own underground entrance. Most Qataris are Wahhabis, followers of a particularly
conservative form of Islam. Both private groups and
government organizations have provided lavish donations
to promote conservative Islam in countries, also in Europe, which
has caused considerable tensions. But there’s evidence that
Qatar is scaling back its activities. Some of that money went
not just to mosques and so on, and dodgy preachers, but to basically jihadi
types around the Arab world. So the Qatari government
clearly saw this as not something that they wanted and they’ve
been cracking down very hard on that with new laws
and very stringent controls to the extent that any
kind of very innocent, charitable collection, you actually have to clear
with the government first. Next I want to try
out Doha’s new metro. Like many
infrastructure projects, it was built as part of the
preparations for the World Cup. All the stations and trains
have good air conditioning, a necessity in Qatar. Because of the heat and because gasoline
is dirt cheap here most Qataris go
everywhere by car. Public transport still needs
to catch on more widely. This metro, unlike
other countries, is a very new concept
in the Gulf region. And we plan on integrating
the metro into the daily lives of all the residents of Qatar, which includes the
Qataris and all the workers. So, it is a challenge, but I believe
we are succeeding going forward. We have plans and we
have implemented some plans to integrate all the
residents to using the metro. As usual, another official is
present during our interview whether to provide support
or to monitor the conversation, is unclear. We continue to get
stopped regularly by police and
security officials, who question us, scan our passports and
compare them with databases. The authorities here are
very suspicious of journalists. Like everyone arriving in Qatar, we were required to
download a Covid app on our cellphones
at the airport. This means we can be tracked at
all times and our phones monitored. Building work is
underway all over Doha. Qatar owes a lot
to migrant workers, many of whom are poorly
paid and not well treated. But under international pressure,
some things do appear to have improved. This building houses the office of the International
Labor Organization. In 2018, Qatar opened
its doors to the ILO and began cooperating
with labor law experts. The ILO says reports that
more than 6,000 workers have died while building
World Cup venues are false. Six thousand five
hundred is the total number of South Asian nationals who
died in Qatar over a 10 year period. It doesn’t distinguish between
whether these are work-related deaths or non-work-related deaths. It doesn’t even distinguish
between whether these are workers or non-economically
active people. We commissioned our own
piece of work to collect data from different hospitals, emergency
departments, ambulances etc. to come up with a
more accurate figure on work-related
injuries and deaths. And in that we saw that there
were 50 work-related deaths in 2020, 506 severe injuries, and 37,000
mild and moderate injuries. Safety standards
have since improved, the ban on working in the heat has been expanded and a
minimum wage introduced. The notorious kafala program, which gave employers
complete control over their workers,
has been scaled back. But these improvements are
not being applied everywhere. The new laws
need to be enforced. Poor working conditions
harm Qatar’s reputation and limit further
economic development. I think those of us
coming from the West can’t even imagine
what life is like for many of the
migrant workers here. They work twelve
hours a day in the heat. They live with 6, 8 or 10
other workers in one room that is just 14 or 16
square meters in size. They work six days a week, 12
hours a day plus one hour travel there and one hour back. That doesn’t leave
much time for themselves. But that’s not only
typical for Qatar, it’s the same in other parts
of the Gulf, and the world, and that should
be reported on too. But OK, other parts of the world aren’t being allowed
to host the World Cup. So are Qatar’s residents
actually interested in football? Mohamed from Egypt
heads a school here. Unlike migrant workers
in the low-wage sector, qualified workers with a
good salary can bring their wives and children to Qatar. I’m very excited, I’m waiting for
all teams to come, watch and enjoy. Also I’m waiting for my
favorite team, Brazil, second team, France, I like
especially Brazil is a very good team. And you like who in Brasilia? Junior Vinicius? What’s your favorite team? Liverpool. What does it mean for
you that the World Cup is for the first time hosted
by an Arab country? The first time in Arab world,
very exciting, I like this. And I think Inshallah Qatar,
she will make something amazing. And we are waiting
for this, all of us, all Arabic people who
are supporting Qatar. Back on the seafront, soccer
also dominates the conversation. It’s a Friday, when
workers have their day off. These young men all
support South American teams. Argentina, Argentina. Argentina is very good! Messi very good playing! I like Messi. What is your favorite team? Argentina, Argentina. All of you Argentina. Brazil! For those who have to work
even on Friday, 5pm is shift change. While some are
arriving for work, others wait for buses
that will take them back to their accommodation
on the edge of the city. Many have since
left the country. Qatar decided to send
them home to create space for hundreds of
thousands of fans. But even here, there’s
no criticism of Qatar or the working conditions perhaps because people are
afraid of repercussions if they talk. One thing seems clear, Qatar says it will not
provide a compensation fund for the families of those who
died on the construction sites, something many have called for. As the sun goes down and the
temperature becomes more bearable, more Qataris can also be
seen out and about at the bazaar. The women wear
the long black abaya, while the men are
dressed in white. This part of the market
sells birds and other pets. Even though the bazaar is newly
built and just made to look old, it very much reflects
traditional Arab culture. Many Qataris were
planning to leave the city before the hordes of
foreign fans descended. Not all of them are happy
about the mega-event and the Western
influence that goes with it. By the standards of the
West, much is not right in Qatar. But some consider the tiny
emirate a model of success by Gulf region standards. The World Cup has
highlighted the struggle in the Arab world to find a balance
between tradition and modernity, between authoritarianism, human rights and the desire to
play a role on the world stage.","The transcript offers an in-depth examination of Qatar's rapid transformation and its contentious hosting of the men’s soccer World Cup. It paints Qatar as a nation steeped in tradition yet propelled into modernity by its oil and gas wealth, developing at an unprecedented pace. As Qatar readies for the World Cup, it faces criticism concerning its treatment of migrant workers who represent nearly 90% of its population. Regulations have been adopted to protect workers from Qatar’s severe summer heat, yet the improvements remain inconsistently enforced. Archive reports suggest thousands of migrant workers have died, but the International Labor Organization disputes these claims, pointing to drastically lower figures for work-related deaths. Journalists scrutinizing conditions often face surveillance and interference, exposing Qatar's sensitivity to negative publicity.",Human Rights Issues,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar
g5ujVKuWRPI,‘A GHOST TOWN!’ One year on from the most controversial FIFA World Cup | ESPN FC,"James Oly you you spent some time in Cutter one year on from the World Cup um World Cup final was December 18th seems crazy this time 12 months ago we were there still one of the more surreal experiences that that I had as a working journalist but of course we're used to this we go to tournaments they create like a little stage for us right whether and it's not just cutter it's Russia Brazil uh Germany all the ones we've been to but this time around you came back to see what's left what is the Legacy and what did you find you're right I mean there these countries are always FIFA sanitized versions of the reality and part of the problem with Qatar was always that there were human rights issues there before that tournament was awarded they weren't given due consideration and essentially in the sort of 12 Years from 2010 to 2022 there was supposed to be this sort of reverse engineering of this idea that well actually okay there may have been transgressions in the past but together with FIFA together with the spotlight that football can put on the country there will be progress in terms of um migrant worker rights and obviously you know most countries have a rich football sort of history that these new stadiums and the new infrastructure kind of folds into that after the tournament what I found was that a lot of these um stadiums are just simply you know Frozen in Time their their their monuments to a tournament that took place a year ago where very little has changed so all of the FIFA World Cup 2022 signage is outside the stadiums they've not taken any of that away you know a lot a lot of the you know you can still go and have your picture taken with the the mascot the tournament um you remember the mascot's name you will I'm sure I it's a little ghost thing yeah know it's well it's and it's it is a little ghost thing and and it which which is weird because in some ways it feels kind of appropriate for what is now now ghost stadiums for what is now bit of a ghost town particularly Luc which is where the final was and and and lucel Boulevard which is one of still ranked as one of the strangest places I've ever been to sort of built built to a capacity that that is still yet to arrive you know I mean even during the tournament it it felt too big for the event that it was hosting because the just the people didn't come in the numbers that they anticipated and that is that that City lale it's about 15 km north of Doha it's quite symptomatic I think of the whole picture because they built and they built and they built and I went back there and there's no one around you know there there's Starbucks empty there's a McDonald's with two people in it there's a Chuck-E-Cheese with no one in it you know and you're thinking what what what are all these restaurant you know there's a sabur there hey SSB is is an English supermarket and a guari one uh as well apparently so yeah for those who don't know lcil is supposed to be the city of the future this hyper technological City I think they estimated that it would grow to a population of is it half a million I think was the goal but it just hasn't worked out that way they they've got this fantastic surreal looking shopping mall there that's uh looks like it's Parisian um with a bit of Venice yeah I mean but there's you know the whole the whole place there are two timelines here there's the the 2022 World Cup timeline which kind of the International Community focused on understandably a tournament of that size going to a country that small with such a minimal football Heritage that's one timeline the qaris are working to another timeline they have their own what they call National Vision which is 2030 timeline and they want to essentially redefine themselves as a country that is not solely um responsible for oil and gas reserves and and and that's all it's known for they want to be known for much more than that and sport is one element of it but this is why it was explained to me by some very wellplayed sources on the ground in in the country that they're not in any hurry to dismantle this these stadiums they're not in any hurry to to remove the infrastructure because they're thinking about seven eight 10 years on they're thinking about trying to get the Olympic Games I think that's the most Open Secret around that they would love to go and get an Olympics you know the and they've got the money frankly they don't they're not interested in you know um scaling down these stadiums a lot of them were going to be scaled down take the top tier off and try and put a hotel yeah I was going to ask about that so in terms of Stadium right so there's the the one stadium that was made up of containers was all going to be disassembled and Sh off somewhere did that happen no it's still there you're joking no it's still there in full not been touched I was told by One Source it could host a game tomorrow the other Stadium I think it's uh albite where the opening game was that I mean this stadium is literally like in the middle of nowhere um just far away from any town I think they were going to take off the top tier and turn that into a conference center yeah it was going to be a shopping center an Elite Training Facility it's all exactly the same it's completely untouched that Stadium I went to it I was told I mean I had a sort of hairy moment there really in that um I started taking some pictures and I started walking around you know you remember there's a big road all the way around on the outside of the stadium just started walking along that road didn't go past any fences didn't go inside anywhere wasn't trespassing inside the stadium ground as it were and the security guards I could hear him in the buggy come up to me and sort of stop me and said you know what are you doing I said oh you know I wanted to see This World Cup stadium and how it had changed and he said oh well you can't take any pictures you can come up to this road but as soon as you go onto the road you're trespassing and I've seen you taking pictures of the grounds and that that Stadium as you say in the middle of nowhere literally in the middle of the desert but had a park a beautifully kept ornate Park through it that Park is you know quite understandably has started to to to Decay um you know the grass has started to to Blacken or brown and um there are Cafe little cafe hubs that were located around the stadium that had just G fallen into disrepair you know it's it's it's but the stadium itself absolutely Immaculate from what I could see of it this is the part which never which never quite added up to me which is it's it's a very small country obviously um small geographically small by population but literally almost everybody lives in in Doha if you're going to build another city LC the city of the future if you're going to have all these stadiums either you're expecting a massive spike in population or they will be empty and I don't think kutar from what we understand has any desire to go through a spike in population it's not like they're it's not like they've gone down the route of say duai which is said right we're going to we're going to bring in people we're going to welcome people from all over the world as long as they have money right to come here and have all the service people to service them and so we need to keep building for all these people come to Dubai where you know if you have money you get to live here no questions asked right Doha hasn't gone down that route so what's the think with building all these all these fancy towers and cities when they're going to be out of date by by the time the assuming the the population grows they're going to have to knock them down and rebuild them right cuz 20 years from now nobody's going to want to live in a 20-y old building the the way it's the way that has been framed to me is that part of the 2030 National vision is that they are still targeting high-end luxury they they don't want volume they want highend they want luxury tourism they want they're quite happy to have those you know these shops and these restaurants empty if five people come in and spend an inord amount of money you know that they'd rather have that than the capacity what I've been told by people on the ground by the way is that the capacity the population of the country has fallen actually quite a lot since the World Cup so we got up to about 3 million of which about 10% were Qatari um indigenous to the to the country um that apparently that number has dropped to about 2.2 2.3 million now so that's a lot of work Workforce that has left the region um and that's part of the reason why I think the ex head of the of Qatar Airways has said that the hotel occupancy rate in April was about 60 to 70% my sources tell me it was about 40% then and it's about 20% in lale so there's a there are huge huge sways of space there and you're right there's not there hasn't been the the post uh World Cup sort of outburst of of of incoming of Migrant workers and and population into the into the country and there's also not been the infrastructure build to anywhere near the same capacity so a lot of the projects apparently are being stalled or being delayed or just being cut all together I know of when I was there I was told that there was a a big highway road construction project where the workers are considering going on strike because it's been slowed to the extent that they're not getting paid and then we get into the whole issue of you know migrant workers having their wage deferred or wage theft as it's known and this is actually exacerbating the problems that FIFA said that they would be there to help address which is the payment of the migrant workers and obviously most Gravely the compensation to the families of the migrant workers who died let's talk about this because this is I think one of the issues that Drew most attention about it um when the World Cup was assigned to to was awarded to Cutter and by the way I think it's a matter of public record I think uh more than half of the people who voted on it executive committee were later found to either have to have taken bribes either in conjunction with this foe or in conduction with a sale of of TV right I think it's a matter of public record I'm not going to get sued over this but um the issue of Migrant workers or migrant labor not just in Cutter but throughout the region which really came to the four as well as the issue of lgbtq Rights um I want to focus on the migrant worker issue because I think that was the one that seemed let's say more more fixable in the sense that cutter the M was like all right look you know we'll do whatever you want us to do we've got money we can take care of everybody certainly in the leadup to the tournament they said that they they passed laws they changed the so-called kafala system they they were going to set up that they've set up hot lines for migrant workers they've improved conditions for a lot of these migrant workers um is a minimum wage they've ined the minimum minimum wage now when I was there and you can tell me if this is still the case one of the things that some of these a organizations were saying well well it's great that you passed the law but ultimately you have a migrant worker from say Nepal who is living in this Camp yeah maybe the Camp's a little nicer if his boss doesn't pay him he has no recourse you know the he may have the right to be paid all these back wages or whatever but if he doesn't know where to go who to turn to if there's no enforcement mechanism um and that's what that was going to be a priority for them is there an enforcement mechanism now from what you can tell so the there's there's two points to make there one is you're right the the qaris would point to the changes that they made in law there's a minimum wage the kafala system which essentially meant that you had to have a sponsor to enter the country by the way sorry if I jump on this point I saw a lot of sanctimony about this from us in the west over the fact that oh if you want to immigrate and work in this country you need a sponsor well guess what if you want to come and work in this country that we live in United Kingdom you need a sponsor if you want to work in most of Europe you need a sponsor if you want to work in the United States you need a sponsor and if you change jobs you need to leave the country and get a different sponsor to come and sponsor your work visa now it's true that there is a path to residency and whatever which maybe doesn't exist in Cutter but it's I don't think it's a gal system itself which was so absurd so getting rid of it no it's it's well they haven't got rid of it that's they've modified it so you still need a sponsor but the one of the big changes is that if you want to leave the country you had to have an exit permit you now don't need one and there are cases of hundreds and hundreds of cases of employees being able to go back to their Homeland without their sponsors they don't keep your passports and all so for example yeah if they wanted say they wanted they go did buy for the weekend theyed an exit permit they now don't need that right um and there are government data figures and again there's debate about how legitimate those numbers are but there's government data figures from uh this month actually that show from I think it's September 2020 to October 2023 there were 660 odd thousand people who managed to change jobs and that is shown as a significant measure of the progress however there are the laws 660,000 yeah out of out of just over a million so significant that is a really that's a big big number it's a big number but I would say it's also quite a big number that a third of those applications were rejected why were they rejected we don't know how long were they did they have to wait it's a big number out of the total population you said if it's down to 2.2 million right and about 250,000 whatever are yeah in those three years in three years in three years it tells you that what about one in three people were able to successfully change jobs some of the others maybe didn't want to change jobs or that's still some level of progress that which that was suggest progress yeah and and and I do and I think as ever with things these days I think people look quite binary with this that it's qatar's either hell on Earth or it's you know actually it's a paradise and a Haven or the reality obviously is somewhere in the middle however when you do talk to uh even even the international labor organization and some of the even even the Supreme committee obviously put the put their best spin on things there there are issues with implementation of these laws so these laws have been changed and that is a fundamentally a good thing but when you come to the implementation there are major issues and the principal problem is wage theft and that is that quite simply I employ you but I have an issue with the amount of work that we've got at the moment so I decide I'm not going to pay you what's your recourse you go to the labor courts and the labor courts can take years to hear your case and in the meantime you get no money it's also again if I'm a guy money if I'm a guy from Nepal yeah I need a lawyer to go to the to to the labor courts right so there was a there was talk and you can tell me if this ever came to frish where we're going to have offices organizations of of local qari lawyers and other International lawyers familiar with Qatari labor laws that will pro bono in fact I think FIFA was going to help fund this even yeah we will support people who have workplace gces is that come to fruition so the ILO have they are essentially a UN agency um which International labor organization yeah and they help um with these kinds of issues all around the world and they have an office in doar again quite a symbolic moment it was suggested I've been to that office it's not particularly big they don't have a particularly great capacity but they are trying to build that capacity so that workers can can go to whether it's a prob owner lawyer whether it's somebody else with knowledge of the ministry of labor and the system and how it works to be able to get the the right paperwork to be able to go through the process to then come out the other side but the pro the major major issue is that there are thousands and some of the human rights campaigners estimate hundreds of thousands of cases that are just being held up in the labor courts to be actually heard and the problem with that is that in the meantime I cannot pay you and if I if I don't pay you Gab marotti sat here in London you can probably be all right for a few months but if you're from the Paul and you're sending money back home and you're living in in in in very modest accommodation how long can you wait before you say you know what I can't hear I can't wait any longer for this case to be heard I'm going home and if you go home you don't get a penny and this is the problem and you might have two or three months of back pay owed to you you might I mean some of these cases uh Human Rights Watch say there are $25 $30,000 that some of these families are waiting for it's just big money you know in cases that they've been working for a decade in in the country and and again we're talking 25 $30,000 in countries like Nepal where I don't know what the annual wage is but I'm sure it's a fraction of that absolute life-changing money and and and this is where we we we have to point the finger to some extent to FIFA because FIFA uh helped push this notion out before the tournament of a migrant workers Center so somewhere a physical building in Doha where these work workers could go could feel safe uh and comfortable and get the expertise that they needed to launch these claims that Worker Center has never been built my understanding is a location has never even been discussed the qaris have resisted that almost from from the minute it was it was publicly suggested now something that Infantino said in his closing speech was as opposed to it being a migrant worker Center he started calling uh a labor Excellence Hub and I've put this phrase to the Trade union who work with the qatar's on the ground to the ILO to the ministry of labor nobody knows anything about this it was mentioned by Infantino in his speech no one knows what it is whether it's supposed to replace the migrant worker Center whether it's supposed to offer some other skill set nobody knows I've asked FIFA to explain exactly what this is does it replace the migrant workers Center is it supposed to be part of the legacy of the tournament I've not had a reply so this is first of all I I find that that shocking and really disappointing but after every World Cup I think since Brazil maybe happen before that FIFA always made it a point that okay out of the money out of our revenue from this world cup we're going to leave something behind as a legacy and obviously when they had the World Cup in Brazil it was very meaningful because it's a big country and they could use it certainly they had a legacy fun I think in Russia as well I don't know if in Cutter they thought that it would be necessary because the country so rich but then they introduced this concept of the Legacy fund I think they said $100 million something like that mhm which would also you know help for people who are injured or or or even deaths on the job uh and also to support these causes were you able to establish what happened with this money did did FIFA pay the money to somebody in Cutter and it's being held up there or no are cutter still waiting for this money nobody has seen that money as far as I'm aware um there are two where it gets a bit confusing is the the qaris have their own fund the workers and I forget the name of it now wsf can't remember what it stands for worker supporters Insurance Fund I think it is so that fund is that fund exists and it's actually funded by the qaris yes and they do pay money out eventually yes and it's paid out over half a million dollars um in and again firstly to say sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry half a million dollars 1.8 million workers I math may or may not be as strong was it like 30 cents a worker well well it's more it's not per worker it's per case so you have to think of how many cases have been heard in that time and how many cases are wasting so this this shows the number of cases that have been processed very very few imagine the scale of the abuses if they've not heard a fraction only a fraction of the cases and they've already paid out half a million us um but in terms of the Legacy fund nobody's seen a penny and I thought it was very significant that when Infantino announced that he said invited countries other associations around the world to pay into the fund and if you paid in to a certain level you get a seat on the board and if you had a seat on the board you could decide where that money went what does that tell you they had no idea where they wanted the money to go they didn't know where the money would go they didn't know how much they would have again I've asked specific questions to FIFA and at the time that we're taping this I've not had a reply about any detail about that money and where it's gone all right I ask you a more personal question here so obviously we know the circumstances under which cutter got the World Cup but when I think back to that World Cup and in terms of the experience there was a lot of things I didn't like locally which didn't have to do with cutter just has to do with the type of people who go to World Cup and what World Cups have become but in time I thought this is going to be an opportunity it's an opportunity since they have money since they say they want to do well since really doesn't take that much effort to make sure that these workers unlike workers in Dubai or Abu Dhabi or Saudi or Oman or baharin other countries in Thea if they're actually treated well you can this is a great opportunity cutter can create a new model for the whole region and it wouldn't cost them that much and it's eminently doable and I told myself that you know what maybe it would be even better if this could be a regional World Cup a new Eng include the Emirates and Saudi and whatever and it elevates the whole region and then obviously that didn't happen and then I said well at least it'll be a chance I went to um there's an Islamic Museum in Doha during the World Cup and I thought all right they're going to have all sorts of initiatives on now it was it was a ghost town when when I went this was during the World Cup I I don't I didn't I went there because a friend of mine told me to go there and I went with them I never saw any of doha's museums really pushed or any of their cultural you know they say they want to be known for Stuff other than oil and gas or sports but it feels like a gigantic missed opportunity I'm gonna ask you the same question that I reflected on I think during the World Cup because I went out of my way to meet them I may I met less than 10 qaris excluding footballers people who were involved for the World Cup or people worked for the Supreme committee did you meet any non football nons Supreme committee guaris did you have that opportunity either on this trip or during the World Cup no see to me this just speaks of a massive missed opportunity oh actually well I didn't I I mean I didn't speak to the qataris but I did speak to migrant workers during the tournament and and I have spoken to two for this for this piece for ESPN no we spoke to them and I and I'm sure we we also spoke to people who've lived in Doha for I actually I did people have lived there for many generation or for 20 30 years and they've made their life there and now have residency but in terms of qar other than people who are involved with the world cup or the Supreme committee and to me that's another big opport big missed opportunity well I mean amnesty released a report last week that suggested that the the legacy of this tournament was in danger of being wrecked by the lack of progress that the qaris have made and it's impossible having spent a few days there to not Echo that wholeheartedly really the look The qaris in the context of the gulf they have made genuine progress and it is important to say that this is not this is not a completely one-sided argument however you scratch the surface of those changes that they've made and you find obfuscation you find needless delay you find ironically a lack of investment and you think well this is the one thing you can do is pour resources into almost anything you want to and they're choosing not to do this and multiple sources on the ground telling me that the cfala system they still the Qatar is still complain about that privately today that we've still look we we built this city on this cfala system we built this country on the cavala system we can't use it it was put to me by one person that um there are companies who you know whose Executives can't sleep at night because they don't know if they're going to have a Workforce in the morning I it's ridiculous that's that that is not the reality on the ground that is not because they think under law technically we can't control our our Workforce our migrant population to the extent that we could have done before this tournament um was awarded to us but the reality is is that they're able with a lack of oversight from organizations like FIFA but of course they're just a football organiz ation they can't be solely responsible for for the implementation but they have absolved themselves of any real post tornament responsibility despite making these quite clear and grand gestures and you were in that Infantino press conference the opening one the the hourong monologue which was an attack on the hypocrisy of the West and you know how can you level all these claims of of migrant worker abuse against Qatar in isolation when you come from a country country you come from Europe you know if we should be apologizing rather than moralizing for everything that Europe's done in the last 3,000 years all this kind of thing this big big speech you got to back that up with the action and not only did he propose to back that up with these series of the Legacy fund the migrant workers center with all of this oversight that he said that would be given he actually said on record to migrant workers if you don't get your compensation if you don't get the money you owe to us come to us we will help you where are they it's a very valid question final point for me um what are the other issues was attitudes towards lgbtq uh Community now I I I know this is very difficult to to measure um not least in a few days and it's something that was always going to take more time but Kar said before the World Cup like you know we're going to be welcoming and Respec F towards everybody as far as I know from what I remember maybe you'll know better than me I don't think there were any any incidents that were flagged in that sense although I remember a couple of journalists who were wearing rainbow colors who were denied entr this stum right and then they they were they but other than other than that but I'm talking about we all know there were lgbtq people at that World Cup as guess um and from what I have noticed there was no reports of people being harassed and whatever now obviously they might not have behaved there in the way they might have behaved back home and public or whatever but do you get a sense that maybe inqari Society said I look we had these lgbtq people here for a month nothing happened so maybe while we still have our own culture our own sense of the Quorum or whatever maybe we don't really need these laws on the book the way they're written now maybe we can just have a more General catchall about modesty or whatever that applies to both straight and lgbtq or something I know it's really difficult because it's difficult to speak to qataris but do you get a sense of that or it's a very that is a very hard question to answer what I would say is that homosexuality is still punishable in some cases by death in that country and it's is written into their law and that law was not changed was not modified at all they did change the cfala laws and the a huge resistance privately and to some extent publicly to that and that's the one that everyone knows about so I think the law that they didn't change I don't think they're really looking to modify that one thing I would say they certainly haven't been from my understanding as as welcoming or have projected the image that everyone is welcome successfully enough to increase tourism into the area I'm told that there hasn't been a a big influx um it's not as if lgbtq plus people have suddenly thought we can go to Qatar like you say well the tournament for a week passed for a month passed off without incident maybe we can go there my understanding from from from officials who work there there's not been a discernable increase in from that Community going to the area so again it feels like another missed opportunity if that if that's true if there is a a proportion of the Qatari population who want to open up and want to be more Progressive in their thinking in that area it certainly hasn't been projected around the rest of the world to the extent that people have come and taken the risk to see if it has changed I was thinking more about qari residents both native Qatari and migrants who might be members of that Community do they have do they find that maybe attitudes are a are a little bit different than what they were before as a result of said World Cup passing without incidents but I think that's one that's really difficult to measure uh James thank you you so much for taking the time to speak to me and uh pie [Music] up","The transcript discusses the aftermath of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, analyzing the country's current state and its long-term goals. It highlights various issues that emerged during and after the tournament, particularly focusing on Qatar's attempts to address public concerns about its human rights record, including migrant worker conditions and LGBTQ+ rights. The conversation begins with a reflection on the surreal experience of covering the World Cup and the sanitized versions of reality presented during such tournaments. The discussion then moves to the stagnant post-World Cup infrastructure, with stadiums and facilities largely unused and Lucille City resembling a ""ghost town"" due to a significant drop in population and lack of ongoing development.",Human Rights Issues,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar
c9sXyihOO8Y,Qatar World Cup 2022 | My Honest Review,good morning everybody and welcome to today's video the FIFA World Cup as well and truly underway and since it's been hosted in the country which is literally on the doorstep to the United Arab Emirates which is one hour away from me by plane I thought it would be rude not to go and check it out for myself and see first of all what the city is like but also to have my very first experience of a World Cup a FIFA World Cup so join me on my journey as I will share with you as much as I can my experience of the World Cup and of this city which I've never been to before foreign was fairly civilized apart from the pilot and decided to Ram the plane into the runway now I'm going to check out some what appears to be some Qatari coffee [Music] my man what makes this so special he makes it yes he's a special coffee mustard strong it's super strong strong and it's not much but as long as it's potent that's all I care about two things are famous in Qatar wanting coffee beans and football footballers who's going to win the World Cup oh I think who's a girl because I am the father of Orlando ah we go to the W Hotel yeah you're from Qatar Sri Lanka foreign the first impressions it's a very beautiful city it looks kind of like similar to Dubai similar to Abu Dhabi very clean very modern you can definitely tell the world cup is on because all the buildings are literally just like painted with FIFA signs and footballers like they're really taking it seriously they're put they have put a lot of effort into this itself come on England foreign best things to do for sure are you coming with us yeah no I was I wish [Music] so we've just touched down at one of the FIFA football fan zones the 900 Park and I must say there's a recurring theme here every single place we go we have to walk through metal detectors so uh they're really taking the safety very seriously here it's a Rowdy one should we get stuck here [Applause] 10. tonight [Applause] so we just got off the Metro wasn't too bad we're about to get two separate trains but it was clean it was efficient certainly Rowdy and now we are outside of the stadium about to go inside yeah yeah honestly tell everyone how this world cup has been it has been very good whatever is being said elsewhere don't listen to it [Music] [Applause] [Applause] is [Applause] foreign [Applause] so yesterday was absolutely fantastic couldn't have asked for a better first experience of the World Cup watching my home country win three now it was actually quite funny because obviously we're playing Wales so it felt like I was back in the UK because all the fans around me were English-speaking stadium was Immaculate no drama no violence no problems everything was very smooth well organized only minor setback was getting the train back to downtown there's a bit of a queue but apart from that was absolutely fine strong police presence uh they clearly didn't want anyone kicking off and anyone being violent and to be honest with you that's one thing which I notice if I compare say for example when I was back in the UK watching football games people are drinking a lot and whenever they drink that's usually when they get violent there's usually it's fights and all sorts of kickoffs but that's something you definitely don't see here and you can imagine that's something they are trying to prevent so they're doing a pretty good job of that the hotel situation I've not spoken about the hotel much um as you can imagine being the World Cup all the hotels around Qatar uh well Doha in particular absolutely ramped up in prices it is what it is it's not exactly a cheap trip there's a lot of people who want to be here right now but um just got to take the hit I'm staying at the W because it's the W and it's certainly a bit of a vibey hotel there's a bar downstairs there's a club as well so um there's a lot to do a lot on offer so this is a map of Doha this is where I currently am City Center I'm going to be moving to the Pearl which is a man-made Island which has been recently developed and I think I'll be spending quite a lot of time around here there's quite a lot I'm not gonna have time to explore unfortunately especially this region here which I believe is the old Doha apparently the souk is really worth visiting but it's crazy to see how a city which isn't that huge is absolutely littered with stadiums I think they've built eight stadiums just for this world cup so I'm currently just scootering around on uh one of the many e-scooters which you're lying about here and I've noticed there's not really many people around I don't know if this is just like a thing in Qatar that like no one's very active in the morning I mean it's Saturday so I guess it's there Sunday here technically but I'm just by the uh official main hire FIFA Fan Festival which is where it is about I don't even know how many people are gonna be coming here tens of thousands of people right now is very quiet I'm gonna try and meet up with uh one of the women who's actually organizing this and ask her a few questions and see how how it's all been going so far we've been open every single day we're open every single day of the tournament um we're screening all the matches we've got live performances music an ice skating arena how many people come here every day uh between our capacity is 3 500. okay so uh and then people have to buy tickets beforehand to get in whether you have a higher card or not this FIFA fans though you can't consume alcohol but it's in some of the other ones you can yes so we we are a family friendly fan Zone space um and so because of that we decided we were going to be a dry zone no alcohol that makes sense yeah so far I'm a little bit disappointed by the daytime activity it's currently 1 30 and I've just been scootering around trying to find A vibe a bit of liveliness but I haven't found anything it's very quiet and um there's not actually a lot of people around I mean there's a few a lot of people walking around with different football tops from different countries but I was kind of hoping for I don't know something interesting to do during the daytime I feel like at the moment things don't really start to get going until four or five o'clock just before the first matches maybe I'm looking in the wrong places but as far as I know this is it should be one of the main touristy areas so I was just about to get an Uber home but someone who's very kindly offered to give me a lift you're a resident here yeah a wrestling here for the last seven years you like guitar I like it I like it I prefer to buy but yeah Qatar is great yeah what would you say the the main differences are I would say Obviously the size and then Qatar is a bit more conservative than uh than Dubai and for sure there are less distractions here how have you uh found the World Cup so far I find it I found it a bit weird I mean it's uh it's a World Cup and yeah there's people but we were expecting way more people and people are like like concentrated in spots here you know like for example right now we are in a characteristic spot but you you can see there's there's no people around now I'm currently on the Pearl and it's predominantly made up of residential buildings restaurants cafes and other things it looks quite nice it reminds me of jbr and Marina in Dubai seems like a nice spot I was here a little bit earlier on it seemed quite quiet but I've spoken to a few people and they say that it becomes very Lively at night time once the sun sets me okay so I found out why everyone has been hiding there's a spot on the Pearl called the Quanah water and yeah it's absolutely packed full of people full of different nationalities there's flags all over the streets all the buildings are painting differently spot foreign foreign [Music] [Applause] oh my God I found two Brazilians do you want to go to the Brazil game today [Music] everybody [Music] thank you [Applause] very much Brazil are the worst Brazil are the worst Brazilians they lost the Cameroon Brazil Brazil lost the camera foreign service at the airport on the way home my trip has come to an end unfortunately there's a lot more I would like to see and do here in Qatar but my time has run out for now so one hour trip back to Dubai and I'm going to give you my final review of this trip and my experience with the World Cup so here's my review first of all I would say overall it was well organized and it was a pretty decent first attempt at hosting a World Cup for a Middle Eastern country a couple of downsides some minor things like in the stadium they were only accepting payments via Visa so if you had a MasterCard they just wouldn't accept it so that was very annoying uh uh the higher card and application was generally pretty confusing I thought they kept changing the rules and it wasn't made very clear who could actually go into the country so say for example I had my cameraman who I wanted to bring with me but from what I read they said the people who did not have tickets for any of the games would not be allowed into the country which I thought was a little bit unfair and I think that was one of the reasons why it felt as though there was something missing there I mean obviously you have nothing to compare it to it was my first world club experience but I felt like there should have been a little bit more atmosphere and more going on particularly in the daytime but I think because they were restricting how many people they were letting into the country it kind of made sense because it is a very small city in the whole of the World Cup is taking place in this one city so for them to not try and regulate how many people are coming into the country and into the city makes sense because otherwise it would have been overwhelmed that it would have been a disaster so that was a bit of a downside and it would have been better if the rules were a little bit clearer and they weren't changing things last minute let's say for example you know being allowed to drink in the stadium and then in terms of the migrant workers I think this is this is a this is a touchy topic and without a doubt the construction workers who were building all the facilities for the World Cup they definitely had a very very rough time and particularly in the summer months when it gets really hot and really humid I can't imagine what it must have been like to work on a construction site but the question is I don't know if this is the responsibility of the host country or of the construction companies who are employing these migrant workers so something definitely needs to be done and hopefully because there's been so much Limelight on Qatar and this issue things are going to change there's going to be more rules and regulations in the first place and hopefully this is also going to spread out throughout the Middle East and the rest of the world because it isn't just an issue with Qatar it's the whole of the Middle East region you know Saudi Arabia the UAE a lot of this is unfortunately going on it has been going on for a long time I just think it's very unjust that Qatar all of a sudden gets all of this negative attention regarding that subject when you know it's been going on for so long where have all these voices been in the first place beforehand so um like I said hopefully things change and I do feel bad for a lot of those construction workers who had to undergo those brutal conditions Piers Morgan did a very interesting interview recently where you could see both sides of the story so I really do recommend that you watch that but overall my experience was very good and I will without be going back to Qatar to explore and see what else it has to offer and as I said before pretty decent effort for a Middle Eastern country hosting the World Cup particularly a country of such a small size both geographically and in terms of population thank you all for watching and sticking all the way to the end much appreciated and I hope you have enjoyed the video so uh

kQdrgesj8p8,Inside a World Cup FAN VILLAGE CABIN (FIFA World Cup 2022 Qatar),there's to us uscom they've asked if people have booking.com booking.com welcome to the World Cup in Doha guar I'm Juliana my name is Martin and this week we're showing you all about what the World Cup is really like to attend we already showed you the cruise ship that is one of the most luxurious accommodations in Qatar 2022 but we've changed the ations and I'm a little nervous about today's video so right now we're going to stay in one of the cheapest accommodations of the World Cup that is a fan Village or how people over here call it the containers yes and as containers are right we're going to be showing you what the cabins are actually like what the grounds are like is this whole thing a disaster because from what I've seen before we came here I don't know I'm a little bit nervous so stay tuned to the end because we also going to tell you our honest opinion about this entire world cup how we really think about how kataris handle it and I think our opinion is going to surprise you but in the meantime let's check out the fan Village so we've just arrived to the fan Village and the first thing I see is a sign says cheer up I hope this isn't an indication of how this is going to gr maybe it's a translation issue I hope so we've arrived to the pan Village and uh let's just say there's really no point of getting here early that's right uh they told us we have to wait till 4:00 in order to do checkin which is kind of annoying because you know this is a desert so we leave our luggage over there and we're kind of wandering around yeah I mean I guess rules are rules on the cruise ship we were able to check in and actually stay as long as we wanted we shouldn't have left it's all right obviously people are checking out today so they have to clean the cabins um let's just take a look around watch a little bit of the game oh yeah right now there's a game at 1:00 which is in 7 minutes so we're hoping that they will show it over [Music] [Applause] [Music] here all right the first thing that we notice is like people their buildings a little wall let's say like that we so fast I don't know how to call it the bean bag the bean bag they making like a big wall so it gets shade so you can see or l down and the other side and they have the shadow that's genius good news is that we find a little H piece of shade yeah piece of shade the bad news is the screen is that way so we cannot watch the game now this is what we were worried about it's 1 hour before check in and there's already a big line yeah and it's not moving um so we're going to see how long this takes but uh this is this may be [Applause] that what just happened Mar somebody just have a room and everybody's very excited and it's 3:20 for the record so um s good technically on time technically so it's been a little bit more than an hour putting in the line but the good thing is we're having fun every time one person got got his checking the keys we're like hey at least we're having fun and we have the sound of the uru match over there you're so optimistic I'm not a complaining he are you guaranteeing rooms here no here you can guarantee we have a reservation you have reservation I know to tell us to give us where where under fr I think we'll be fine I think the people in the back booking.com they've asked if people have booking.com booking.com this is turning into a completely different video than we thought we came in with really good attitudes excited to show you guys what's happening but um they're trying to send us to a different area of the city because it's just been announced they' oversold the rooms people are pissed they said this should be a guaranteed reservation it's not looking [Applause] goodx 5:00 we got the key it's completely bittersweet because we're so happy we have a key but at the same time we were at the front of the line there was about 10 people in front um so I'm feeling really bad for everybody else what advice do you have Martine eat your vegetables okay well not life advice oh just arrive early and whenever 1 hour before the check in just try to make a line also bring water and very very important bring your voucher that make things way easy let's take a look inside okay oh thank God oh my God oh my God we did it we did it Joe it's not that bad it's not as bad let's show you around one huge concern we had when booking this reservation was is there going to be air because the images of the C cabins were rendered and when you would zoom in we didn't see air anywhere and to our Fortune there is air let's show you it this is our air also a fan there's no problems in our relationship but we do have separate beds that was the only option available one thing I heard in Facebook in the comments of Mexicans going to katar as the bed it could be a little bit hard so let's try it out see oh my God oh my God no no no like I thought like I thought they were overreacting guys this this is firm this is where is the cushion all right but there's a few positive things we have sheets I saw a video where somebody didn't even have sheets we have actually a few little I don't know nice touches like a side drawer light like thing where you can plug in your phone to charge obviously the air is a huge win and actually I'm very impressed that there's privacy here everybody has their windows closed you're not looking into somebody else's room um and I I think I see a a mini fridge actually hey it's better than what I expected now let's check out this bathroom because I'm skeptical about the plumbing there's a little bit of a leak over over there H you no no no I think it was from somebody using the b day you think so yeah that's good let's just not think about that so the size of the shower I think is kind of the same as the one that we used to have in the cruise ship if you haven't seen that video you have to see it but you know what actually in general I think the entire cabin is bigger than the cruise ship one we had it could be you're right just a surprise very nice mirror for me to do my makeup huge sink huge with the both uh brush our teeth brush our teeth at the same time oh what there's uh what socks oh we love the attention to detail that the uh the cleaning crew has had moving on it brushes it's actually pretty good water pressure okay okay I'll take it okay these tour is over of this amazing beautiful cabin why because I really want to see the score of uruguai against South Korea and I also want to put something in my belly we're waiting too much so let's [Music] go dad always taught me that you have to you have to eat you have to sleep and you have to Feast somebody I think we got those last two covered now we're looking for something to eat I was a little worried speaking of firefest I was worried there wouldn't be any food I was worried we'd have to live off of chees sandwiches but actually to my surprise there's plenty of options actually a little more than the cruise ship the prices seem to be better so we just ordered two schwarma two fries two soft drinks it was 59 at the local currency about 16 us that is cheaper than a beer on the cruise ship so this is a little bit different than the cruise ship in the cruise ship you have a screen in your room so you can watch the games over there or you have the different bars but over here there's only one big screen so all the people that are gathering and there's a different Ambience it's nice this is very cool guys actually there's a supermarket inside of the village so let's get crazy and they really have everything it's not just like a little snack little drink no they have full-on vix Vapor Rub I'm sure I could find the duct tape here too that I needed earlier oh so we had this idea to talk to you guys about our honest opinions about the World Cup and how guitar has handled all the people here and if you would have asked us to make this video maybe two hours ago I think we would have had some different things to say definitely let's start with the positives and I can speak about these because I've been attending different stadiums different games all through Qatar and I think trans transportation is a good one amazing yes a good one I mean just imine which city can actually handle just receiving millions of visitors and then you don't have to make a line I don't I can't tell you a single City uh that I can think of that would have been able to handle this amount of volume it is unprecedented compared to other World Cups this is the first time everybody's going to one single City and Qatar has blown it away with the transport not only is it free but buses are always there we've had multiple buses lined up at a time ready to go after the games uh the Metro we've never had to stop but I will say there's a lot of walking as a result of it that's how they've been able to manage the crowd control yeah and the meod they put like some uh oh yes they put stanions up long long stanion but people don't generally have to wait or stop I have to wait in one game in the Calif International Stadium but in the other ones I think was pretty much yeah but in general transportation was amazing and that's actually what I had been concerned about the most would we even be able to get to the game and it's free there small gift from Saudi Arabia oh thank you so much thank you so much thank you so much what is it lend l oo amazing to calm us down by the way uh you have ha card right you can visit Saudi Arabia now without Fe oh really oh that's cool I love people from Saudi Arabia I had a lot of Saudi Arabian friends in college and they're just the nicest people the other thing I will say is check in aside this experience at the fan Village 20 times better than what I thought it was going to be cabins are clean the size of socks cabins are sufficient there's plenty of food the energy here is great overall I mean you get what you pay for if you've ever stayed in a hostel you're going to be just fine it's I think it's even elevated from a hostel yeah I mean the negative thing I have to say is during the checking process it's very very slow and you have to wait Under the Sun and well we were lucky but I don't know if there were people that they didn't receive their keys so I I I want to mark it as negative that only that aspect but yes overall I think for what we've paid is what we got so that is the real fan Village yeah don't forget to check the other videos that we have made we're showing how the World Cup really is so long trouble and make the world your neighborhood see you guys next time bye curious what camera gear we use while traveling want to rock some of our awesome merch or maybe you just want to Discount with some of our favorite companies make sure to check out the description of this video for links to all these things and more [Music] oh,"The transcript provides a firsthand account of attending the FIFA World Cup in Qatar and staying in the Fan Village, known as the ""containers."" The video creators, Juliana and Martin, start by explaining their initial nervousness about staying in what is considered one of the cheapest accommodations available for World Cup fans. They concern over logistical aspects like check-in time and the quality of amenities compared to luxurious options like cruise ships. They document an inconvenient delayed check-in process at the Fan Village, where they had to wait under the sun due to oversold rooms. Although frustrated initially, they maintain a positive outlook, highlighting the camaraderie among fans and the availability of essentials such as air conditioning and privacy in the cabins. The accommodation setup, including separate beds and firm mattresses, receives mixed reactions. On the plus side, they discover a supermarket and reasonably priced food stalls within the village.",Other,0,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar

It discusses the significant investments Qatar made, including $200 billion in infrastructure such as eight high-tech stadiums, metro expansions, and facilities designed for the World Cup. Despite the massive financial outlay for the event, there are concerns about the underutilization of these facilities post-World Cup, such as empty metro stations and unused stadiums that were promised to be repurposed for communities. The narrative touches on the controversial human rights issues tied to the event, noting unofficial reports of up to 6,500 migrant worker deaths during construction, contrasting with the government's claim of only three fatalities. The everyday reality post-World Cup appears stark, with elaborate infrastructure seemingly left inactive and expensive hotels facing financial losses due to low occupancy. The transcript also explores the socio-cultural dynamics, mentioning scams targeting tourists, the luxurious yet scarcely populated metro system, and societal norms reflected in street rules. Lastly, it introduces a conspiracy theory questioning the fairness of the World Cup final match, hinting at rumors of possible bias towards Argentina, although countered by the epic nature of the match itself.",Human Rights Issues,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar
xPta_JXwSc0,Is Qatar Worth Visiting After the World Cup? Doha  🇶🇦,hello and welcome back to the channel from Doha Qatar my 61st country and my first trip outside of Europe here in 2023 as you can see it is very windy here standing with debris coming in from the Persian Gulf in this video I'm going to wander around Doha the capital today visiting the Corniche which is this walkway running along all the way towards the skyscrapers and then tomorrow morning I will get up and visit some of old Doha which has an interesting souk I'm only here for a couple of days on my way to another country and I've passed through doha's airport many times but I've never taken the time to actually get out of the airport and spend a couple days and I've been to Bahrain and Kuwait and Saudi and the UAE and so I thought I would take guitar off on my way to a country which I'm not going to reveal just yet you will find out once I get there but until then let's explore this small nation which is best remembered in recent months for holding the World Cup last year I almost forgot to mention as I walk Round the Dow Harbor here towards the Corniche that behind me there is the Museum of Islamic Art it's a beautiful modern building and it contains over 1 400 different pieces of art from three continents so it is worth a visit if you have time oh so this here the Dow Harbor which holds lots of traditional boats I'm sure you can find one to ride and pay a little bit of money for a group or whatever the deal is I'm not too sure I'm just going to continue walking the Corniche if it's already started is full of people here it's a Friday which of course is the day of rest in Islamic countries and some nice Greenery around modern buildings on the other side of the main road there and then the view of the skyscrapers in the distance and the water with the old boats it's a very nice scene here in the late afternoon as I walk along the Waterfront I thought it would be interesting to show you the population breakdown of Qatar because it is quite interesting when you look at the statistics in preparation for the World Cup many migrant workers from different countries came here to help build the infrastructure the Metro the stadiums to work in the restaurants Etc the hotels and when you look at it this is as of 2019 I'm gonna read out the population breakdown qatari's only make up 9.3 percent of the population at 330 000 people so who's number one India 700 000 people 21.8 of the population that means there are twice as many Indians living here in Qatar today probably more by this point than their architaries which is quite interesting indeed second you have bangladeshis making up more than qatari's 12.5 percent then Nepalese 12.5 percent then after qataris who come forth Egyptians make up 9.35 there are many Egyptians here as there are qataris then it goes on Philippines Pakistan Sri Lanka Sudan Syria Jordan Lebanon so a very diverse population and you'll see that when you walk around most people are not Qatari and so that must have changed the country in so many ways over the last couple of decades in preparation for this world cup I know there are a lot of Migrant workers before the World Cup anyway and if you look at the population breakdowns of Bahrain and the UAE you see something pretty similar but here in Qatar given the fact the population is under 3 million it's really easy to influence the statistics if 700 and something thousand Indians suddenly come and work here and so what you have now is all this influence from these different countries where you've got a great diversity of food people that you're going to bump into on the streets and in general the culture of the country has probably changed dramatically foreign Buddies here is the rather well-known Pearl Monument which is symbolic to qatar's history once having a fairly thriving purling industry so the Corniche Promenade here is seven kilometers long I don't quite know how far I'm gonna make it if I will reach those skyscrapers on the other side it bends all the way around there but let's see I hope my microphone is holding up well with the wind sound the breeze is very strong here I'm even wearing a jumper many of you might be thinking you're in Qatar what are you doing wearing a jumper well it is February and they do have slightly colder temperatures here than you might think in January February and also in December so it's around 22 degrees today but this Breeze means the walking around in the t-shirt it's actually a little bit chilly probably one of the good things about qatar's location you have a nice breeze constantly coming in from the Persian Gulf [Music] of course as many of you know the FIFA World Cup was held here late last year and although lots of people have their arguments about the controversies you could say surrounding the World Cup I think overall it's been a very positive thing for the country because how else do you improve certain things like the lives of Migrant workers without having scrutiny which then enforces change I personally wasn't here for the World Cup of course this is my first visit but from the outside it seemed like a success I don't know what it was like to be here as a supporter to use the Metro when it was really busy when all the hotels were booked how was the service and all these things if you enter the World Cup you can leave your comments below share your experience here but in terms of the football I think it was quite a successful World Cup we had some of the best matches we'd ever seen Saudi Arabia beating Argentina in the first match and seeing teams like Morocco get very far South Korea beating Portugal there are many examples of the underdog winning tunisia's famous one-nil win against France it was very entertaining to watch on my laptop whilst I was in Morocco for most of the World Cup probably the country has seen a lot of improvements and changes you would hope that the World Cup has brought a lot of positivity to this country and a lot of things to be hopeful for for the future and I've never been one to say that we shouldn't visit a certain country because of this particular thing or that I don't want to dive too much into politics but obviously I've been to many countries around the world and Qatar is no different I don't boycott countries because of politics and things like that I go there with an open mind and don't try to force my views on people who have lived a different life with a different history and different background to myself great views here of the skyscrapers across the way I'm going to continue walking on a bit further I don't quite know how far I'll get but let's see foreign [Music] [Music] foreign so I continued my walk along the Corniche and I just had some food here at this restaurant called Al Morgan which has amazing views of doha's skyline I just had Falafel and taboule and I'm gonna end things here for today tomorrow morning I'm going to make my way to the main souk in Doha which is on the other side where I came from so I will try some katari food then and I will see you in the morning hello good morning and welcome back to Doha I am staying just down there at somewhere called Hampton which is very close to the Hilton and this morning I am gonna walk from where I'm staying to the metro station and then it is one stop to the nearby souk I want to show you the Metro because it is the world's largest driverless Metro recently opened and it's quite an interesting experience to take it so let's go as we make our way take a look at this architecture it's a very unique and interesting Style with Arab influence yet there's like a touch of modernity with the blue glass on there what do you think of it let me know in the comments below there's lots of buildings that look like this so my metro stop is called National Museum and get an idea of what some of the buildings and areas look like as we had a bit more Inland from the Corniche I showed mostly the Waterfront yesterday as you might expect everything brand spanking new it's 10 Qatari Reales for one of these little cards and then it costs just two reals for one Journey and you can top them up and use them so I'm going just one stop to souk joaquif there are three different classes on the Metro train you have gold which is another tier which you pay more for on your card then there is so this is gold right here then you have family I guess women and children [Music] and then after family is standard which is where I belong and the picture is just of three men color of the Qatari flag and a pretty cool feature here is that there's two seats right at the front and you can view doors the journey the last season so as you can see the Metro here is pretty impressive it gets a lot busier at other stations it's because I'm at the end of the line and it's kind of uh the late morning it's not so busy right now it's actually one of the fastest metros in the world as well I think the trains reach up to 100 kilometers an hour at times this way to the souk [Music] another gorgeous modern building over there I believe it is a cultural center that one let me know in the comments if you have more knowledge about it than I do according to my Google Maps the entrance to the souk is round about here I don't know if it's a main gate or something but this is where it begins at least on First Impressions I have to say it feels quite modern and clean yet these buildings date back to the late 19th century and early 20th century they have been renovated extensively since 2006. [Music] it's a very pleasant area though and somewhere that could be a nice light introduction to the Arab world in a very kind of sanitized way I think thank you [Music] certainly a lot of places to pick up different souvenirs [Music] sit down outside have a bite to eat maybe a tea or an Arabic coffee foreign if Disneyland made a ancient Arabian section with these buildings here the way they've been made to look rustic the Qatari flag flying high there despite feeling quite modern there is a slight charm to it especially on a relaxed Saturday morning here where you have a mix of locals tourists and as I've been walking around I've seen Persian restaurants azerbaijani Syrian Lebanese so there is a real mix of different options to delve into in terms of food thank you if you could come here for a meal in the evening or something like that I think you would also find quite a good atmosphere as well as here in the morning where it's fresh and more relaxed weather-wise I had to take off my jumper because the heat was starting to get to me for the first time a lot less Breezy than yesterday so I'm gonna Now find somewhere to try some Qatari food hopefully it will feel authentic let's see all right so I'm now sat down here in typical guitar style it's very quiet and I've got the national dish of Qatar which is you can get it generally with chicken mutton which are the two most popular versions but you can also have it with Fish And it is a slow cooked Smoky rich flavor and here it's coming accompanied with salad soup here we go I've just about managed to fit everything in the frame so I'm gonna do this with my hands as is the traditional way this one has more pieces of caramelized sort of dried onion leak into the mutton it is very hot there you go [Music] just like falling off the bone like in Saudi Kuwait Bahrain you get huge portions immense amounts of rice so don't be too ashamed if you can't finish it all generally you share it with other people and um it's kind of in the culture not to always finish everything it's kind of just showing the sign of abundance by giving you more than you need in terms of the hospitality particularly in Arabic culture all right so I've now finished my lunch and I'm back here near my hotel where I'm staying and I'm going to end the video here I hope this gave you an idea of what Doha is like it is worth coming to for a few hours on a layover and to see somewhere a bit different on your way to Asia or on your way to Europe or wherever it may be and I'm gonna catch a flight tonight I need to get back to my hotel take a shower and check out and then make my way to the airport and I will not reveal where I'm going as I said at the beginning of this video stay tuned for the next one to find out where I'm going to be see you then cheers [Music],"The transcript is a travel video of the creator exploring Doha, Qatar.

It captures Michel Platini, a former UEFA chief, who was being questioned by French judicial police regarding his involvement in the selection process. The small, wealthy nation of Qatar, despite its scorching climate and limited football history, won the bid, leading many to speculate about the role of politics and trade influences in the decision. Platini had initially supported the United States as the host before shifting his vote to Qatar. Critics suggest that the shift was influenced by political dealings, possibly including a meeting between Nicolas Sarkozy, the then French president, and Qatari officials. Questions persist, especially since Qatar did not meet the required criteria according to FIFA's safety committee. Despite his illustrious past as a footballer, Platini's reputation as a football administrator is tarnished, partly due to a controversial payment from Sepp Blatter, FIFA's former head, which resulted in his being banned from the sport for unethical conduct. The investigation into these matters continues, indicating potential further consequences for Platini's career reputation.",Sportswashing,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar

despite being a consummate showman he looked oddly nervous as he fumbled for the card inside he pulled it out and announced the host of the 2022 World Cup finals a race that had been viciously competitive embroiled in corruption allegations and dominated by real politic Qatar earlier in the day Russia had been announced as the host of the 2018 World Cup finals beating England's bid it was a decision that had been of importance at the highest level the 2014 British parliamentary report later outlined how an investigative research Company formed by an ex-mi6 agent later named as Christopher Steele had been keeping tabs on the Russian delegation on behalf of the failed England bid paying special attention to Roman Abramovich who they believed had a key role in winning the bid an xmi6 Source believed to be steel later told the Sunday Times when Abramovich turned up in South Africa and started glad handing people that was a turning point Steele later went into hiding after being outed as the author of a salacious raw intelligence dossier detailing the connections between Russia and the future U.S president Donald Trump Bonita messiades a member of the failed rival Australian 2022 bid recounted to the BBC World Service just how seriously everything was being taken the intelligence agencies that were there said it was really noticeable when the Russians turned up because no one could hear or see anything the Russians she explained had jammed everyone else's devices now Russia was yet to become the international Pariah that it is today so it was qatar's announcement that caused bafflement and Jubilation in the crowd the Qatari royal family embraced Emir Tani dressed in a suit took to the stage and set blatter handed in the World Cup but around the world there was disbelief how on Earth did Qatar win the entire bidding process for both the 2018 and 2022 finals were mired by allegations of corruption from the start accusations that both the Russian and Qatari bids strenuously deny to this day even before the vote two members of FIFA's executive committee the 24-person body that would ultimately decide the winner had been suspended Nigeria's amosodamu and tahiti's Reynold tamari had been the target of a Sunday Times undercover sting journalists posing as a fake consultancy filmed the pair agreeing to vote for the U.S bid in exchange for millions of dollars to fund personal football projects both deny the allegations and there was also the controversial figure of Muhammad bin hamam the Qatari president of the Asian football Confederation won our football's most powerful men he was rumored to have played an important behind-the-scenes role in lining up support for the bid in the immediate aftermath of the 2010 vote FIFA president set blatter was challenged for the job by binhaman and he was close to dethroning blatter too but then he was destroyed by allegations that he had approved bribes in return for votes FIFA banned him from football-related activities for life he appealed and won a reprieve from the court of arbitration for sport and although he's always denied any wrongdoing he quit football and returned to Qatar to tend to his family's engineering firm the ban was reinstated six months later after a FIFA Ethics Committee investigation found Ben hamar guilty on a separate charge of breaching FIFA's ethics code with regards to conflicts of interest between his job as AFC president and as a member of FIFA's executive committee but most intriguing of all was Qatar gate after Qatar won the right to host the World Cup the Qatar investment Authority went on to buy PSG earned six months after the 2022 vote Al Jazeera Sports agreed a TV rights deal with the French league worth 450 million euros over five seasons a France football investigation alleged that UEFA president Michelle platini had been asked to vote for Qatar by then French president Nicolas Sarkozy it was alleged that the president had hosted a secret lunch at the Elise Palace for the Crown Prince of Qatar Sheikh tamin binhamin altani and Michelle platini at the lunch it was alleged that the Qatari delegation offered to buy PSG the team Sarkozy supported clear its debt and spin off a new sports TV network from Al Jazeera what would become known as be in sports to buy French televised football rights set blatter later in 2015 told the financial times that platini and the rest of the FIFA executive committee had a gentleman's agreement that the U.S should win the bid just one week before the election I got a phone call from Michelle platini and he said I am no longer in the picture because I've been told by the head of state that we should consider the situation in France he said Qatar has always rejected any suggestion that they won the bid improperly then platini responded forcefully saying to say that my choice was part of a deal between the French State and Qatar is pure speculation and lies he said I do not rule out legal action against anyone who casts doubt on the honesty of my vote Sarkozy is never publicly commented but it's also believed that he denies the allegations so given all of the controversy about the two decisions FIFA was forced to commission an investigation former U.S attorney for the southern district of New York Michael J Garcia was put in charge and two years later he delivered what became known as the Garcia report FIFA at first refused to release it except for a heavily truncated executive summary which exonerated Qatar and Russia but Garcia resigned saying that his work was being misinterpreted still the Garcia report and a subsequent U.S justice Department investigation did help to uncover Decades of historic allegations of corruption of the 24 FIFA executive committee members in place in the run-up to the 2010 vote 9. blatter binham platini tamari and adamu along with Jack Warner Ricardo texera Chung mon Joon and Rafael salguero had bans from football upheld for a variety of offenses that later came to light after the vote some related to the vote itself and others for historical allegations of corruption for example Michelle patini was later banned from football by FIFA for four years over an unconnected 2 million dollar payment he received from blatter in 2011. around the time platini was considering challenging blatter for the FIFA presidency both men claimed the payment was for work that platini had undertaken years earlier and was still owed for blatter was also banned from football over that payment in 2019 platini was questioned by the French authorities over Qatar 2022 he denies any wrongdoing their investigation into allegations of corruption surrounding the bid remains ongoing two more Julio grandona and Nicholas Leos were accused of corruption but have since died Chuck Blazer the Larger than Life former U.S soccer executive who famously had two apartments in Trump Towers one for him one for his cats and who would travel around his New York neighborhood on a mobility scooter with a pet parrot on his shoulder was swept up in a U.S federal investigation he was charged with tax evasion and later turned State's witness admitting that he'd conspired with other exco members to accept bribes in relation to previous World Cup bids he died in 2017. seven more were later cleared of allegations of

for the World Cup had been long problematic corruption allegations surrounded the successful bids of both the 2006 World Cup bid in Germany and South Africa 2010.

funding what it viewed as a humanitarian project in the backyards of the men who would actually vote on the World Cup bids they could also count on high-profile World Cup ambassadors like Zinedine Zidane and Pep Guardiola amongst others and there was high politics too in 2015 the Sunday Times alleged that the intelligence gathered by the England bid had raised suspicions that a huge gas deal struck between Qatar and Russia may have been part of a World Cup vote swap deal another huge gas trade was also struck with Paraguay of course it could all be a coincidence and all three countries deny that the World Cup bid and the gas deals were connected in December 2010 Qatar was Victorious the victors believed the noise around the bid would subside and would be long forgotten by the time

Aid to support Abdel fatah el-sisi's new anti-muslim Brotherhood regime the two sides essentially had been at War via their various proxies in Syria and later Libya for years but what really

ITKOCKpEca8,The Qatar World Cup Explained - Episode One,"The Qatar World Cup has provoked strong and
sometimes conflicting, reactions in many people. Shock.
Incredulity. Disgust.
Pride. Jealousy.
Resignation. Since the tiny Persian Gulf state won the
right to host the tournament in 2010 it has been constantly embroiled in controversy;
over corruption allegations surrounding the bid itself, over the poor treatment of migrant
workers that have built the World Cup's infrastructure and over the lack of human rights and democracy
in the country. But there is a wider story, which isn't just
a story about those things, although they are all important. Qatar's World Cup isn't
merely a sports tournament and neither should it be seen as an outlier, a black swan event
which could neither be predicted or likely replicated.
No, Qatar's World Cup should rather be seen as a product of global political, military,
economic and technological currents that have their roots as far back as the mid-19th century
but centred on the tumultuous end of the 20th century. It is an avatar for a new world with
new rules. The Qatar World Cup has its roots in war,
corruption, revolution and the rise of the super-rich and its geopolitical implications
have helped reshape not just the Middle East but also the rest of the world
Consider these three seemingly unconnected events. They take place thirty two years ago,
within months of each other, in three very different parts of the world.
In the United Kingdom, on January 19th 1990, the final Taylor Report is released. The inquiry
is led by Lord Justice Taylor into the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans crushed to death at Hillsborough
stadium in Sheffield, during an FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest. It was the worst
stadium disaster in Europe and in the immediate aftermath Liverpool fans are blamed for the
tragedy. The Taylor Report put the blame squarely on poor policing and decrepit infrastructure.
It took another two decades, and constant campaigning by Liverpool fans to force the
government to admit there had been a cover up by the police to smear the dead and deflect
blame from the state's failures. But the most immediate effect in 1990 was a revolution
in stadium building and design. The Taylor Report highlighted how a crumbling
Victorian stadium – the kind of stadium replicated across the country – played a
role in the disaster and was unfit for purpose. The report recommended that standing terraces
be banned, which they were. All seater stadia were introduced, a revolution that would change
English football forever. Without this reform, and others, it would not have been possible
to form the Premier League two years later. Within a decade the English Premier League
was on its way to becoming the most lucrative and watched football league in the world.
The league was built in the image of Margrat Thatcher, the British prime minister whose
painful economic reforms alongside US president Ronald Reagan in the 1980s created a deregulated
and deeply unequal economy. A trickle down economy where greed was good and the crumbs
would eventually fall off the table to those less below. That theory didn’t work out.
The wealthy merely saved the extra money or squirrelled it away into tax havens. Inequality
rocketed. The Premier League was neoliberalism’s perfect mirror and the commodification of
English football led to a new class of owner, enticed by the UK and English football's laissez
faire attitude to investment: the newly ennobled and empowered global super rich who saw in
this new fanatically popular global league an opportunity to further their own goals,
whether they were political, financial or more personal. Such was its draw, reach and
power that even nation states began to look at football, in England and beyond, as a viable
investment option. Everything was for sale, and everyone was welcome to buy.
In Moscow, on February 7th 1990, the general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet
Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, recommends that the CPSU gives up its monopoly on political
power. Within weeks the Baltic states and Moldova hold their first ever competitive
elections. On March 11th Lithuania passes the “Act of the Re-Establishment of the
State of Lithuania”, becoming the first Soviet republic to declare independence creating
a domino effect. In August 1991 hardliners desperately trying
to cling to the Soviet Union, and hoping that the people would rally to the Soviet cause,
launch a coup against Gorbachev. Instead, the coup plotters were faced with thousands
of Muscovites who took to the streets in protest. Among them was a young Boris Yeltsin – well,
relatively young given the state of Soviet gerontocracy. He was famously filmed in a
flak jacket, riding a tank. The coup failed. By the end of the year the Soviet Union had
ceased to exist. The hammer and sickle was lowered from the Kremlin, and replaced by
the Russian tricolour. Yeltsin was now president of a newly independent Russia in a new world,
with a new democracy and a new market economy. Those who were smart, lucky or well connected
– usually all three – spotted the gaps in the system where money was to be made,
especially in oil. The fall of the Berlin Wall brought freedom
to millions but also heralded a period of plunder unseen in modern times. It handed
the opportunity to a group of businessmen to take advantage of the chaos to make fortunes
in an opaque fashion. It gave rise to the oligarchs – a Greek word that means ‘rule
by the few’. Under Yeltsin allies became millionaires and then billionaires, after
he concocted a scheme that handed state owned companies – especially in oil, gas and metals
– to trusted figures who could ensure he stayed in power. One of those beneficiaries
was a young man who quietly worked his way into the grace and favour of the new Russian
elite. A rubber duck salesman by the name of Roman Arkardyovich Abramovich. And football
was in the right place at the right time to benefit from the largesse of this new class
of super-rich. On August 2nd 1990, an Iraqi army, 100,000
soldiers strong, invaded Kuwait. Saddam Hussein, Iraq's absolute ruler, had been embroiled
in a decade-long war of expansion and attrition against neighbouring Iran. For a while the
US and its allies backed Saddam against their common enemy the Ayatollah Khomeini. The war
was ruinous. It took a million lives and almost bankrupted the country. Neighbouring Kuwait
had bankrolled Iraq's folly and wanted its billions of dollars in loans repaid. To make
matters worse the price of a barrel of oil had collapsed from just over $40 a barrel
in 1981 to under $12 in 1988. Almost 100 per cent of Iraq's foreign reserves came from
oil sales. And so, on the flimsy pretext that Kuwait was “slant drilling” under the
Iraqi border and stealing Iraqi oil, Iraq invaded and occupied, declaring Kuwait an
Iraqi province and so escaping its debt obligation. Oil prices surged to $41 dollars a barrel.
The occupation was brutal. Although Kuwait emir managed to flee to Saudi Arabia, the
elite that remained were rounded up jailed and tortured. Many were murdered. Sheikh Fahad
al Ahmed al Jaber al Sabah, a brother of the king, was shot and killed whilst trying to
defend the Dasman Palace. His body was laid on the steps and crushed by an Iraqi tank
as a warning to others. Sheikh Fahd had become famous during the 1982 World Cup finals for
entering the field during France v Kuwait, politely remus starting with the ref and persuading
him to disallow a goal he deemed the French had scored unfairly.
Saddam believed western nations were in decline and the US wouldn't have the stomach to commit
ground troops, and troops lives, to what he hoped to turn into a new Vietnam. But the
1990 oil shock the invasion sparked roused Western nations, especially US president George
H. W. Bush. An international coalition was built, including Arab nations who feared that
they would be next. They were right. Saddam had hoped to provoke a ground war, what he
called “The Mother of All Wars”, which he calculated Iraq had the best chance of
winning. After unsuccessfully goading the US by firing Scud missiles into Saudi Arabia
and Israel, and after America's superior ariel forces pounded Iraqi positions in Kuwait,
Saddam ordered a new provocation. Iraq invaded Saudi Arabia and captured the coast port of
Al Khafji. Coalition forces had no choice but to engage. And leading the charge were
two tank companies from Qatar. They rolled into Khafji under the command of a youngish,
unknown Sandhurst graduate; Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani, the crown prince of Qatar.
Qatar history has been moulded by its position between larger competing powers, especially
Saudi Arabia, Iran and Bahrain. It had built a reputation for mediation and negotiation
out of the necessity. The Al Thani family were relatively recent arrivals to power in
the Gulf, taking control in the mid 19th century after signing an agreement with the British
that effectively recognised the Al Thani's claim over the whole Qatari peninsula for
the first time. Still, a few years later, in 1871, Qatar came
under pressure to accept the rule of a weakening Ottoman empire. The Al Thanis survived by
negotiating, cajoling and sometimes revolting. When the Ottoman empire inevitably collapsed
after World War One and retreated from Qatar, the British empire took its place guaranteeing
its security in 1916. The guarantee was vital. The Al Saud had been a continued threat on
its southern border, especially once oil had been discovered in the region at the start
of the 20th century. Back then Qatar was an impoverished pearling
and fishing backwater. One British civil servant posted in Qatar described Doha as “little
more than a miserable fishing village straggling along the coast for several miles and more
than half in ruins. The suq [market] consisted of mean, fly-infested hovels, the roads were
dusty tracks, there was no electricity and the people had to fetch their water in skins
and cans from wells two or three miles outside the town.”
When oil was eventually discovered in 1939 – in the middle of a period of extreme poverty
that Qataris refer to as ‘the years of hunger’ – the population of Qatar stood at just
16,000. Crude oil shipments would not begin to be exported until 1949, and life was still
precarious. In 1960, a quarter of Qatari women still died in childbirth. But oil was now
flowing and Qatar was on its way to becoming a wealthy place. And soon an independent nation.
Britain couldn't afford to be a colonial power any more. So when British prime minister Harold
Wilson announced in 1967 that the country would be retreating from its military bases
‘East of Suez’ it left Qatar with a decision to make. The British had long guaranteed security
for Qatar, Bahrain and the other so called “Trucial States”, including the seven
tribal families who would form the United Arab Emirates. In 1971, a few months before
the UAE’s seven emirates came together, Qatar announced its independence. A year later,
Sheikh Khalifa bin Hamad al Thani snatched power from his disinterested brother, Ahmad
bin Ali, while he was on a hunting trip in Iran.
A modern state was built, with Sheikh Khalifa centralising power, using the money received
from oil. But the oil would soon run out. A more important discovery had been made though:
In 1971 Shell discovered the so-called North Field, the largest single deposit of gas in
the world. In 1977 he named his son, now Major General Hamad, crown prince. The oil price
collapse of the 1980s had a ruinous effect on the finances of Gulf countries. Qatar started
to run a deficit and Iraq was looking for ways to shore up its haemorrhaging exchequer.
And so in 1990 Saddam invaded Iraq and in January 1991, Iraqi tanks rolled into the
Khafji, only to be met by a US bolstered coalition force. But it was important for the Saudis
– for whom the presence of non-Muslim troops on their soil was a sticky subject – that
Arab forces led the fightback. And they did. It was under Sheikh Hamad's command that Qatari
tanks were one of the first to engage with Iraqi troops. It was the first time the Qatari
army had ever been engaged, and it was a turning point of the Gulf War, forcing Saddam's troops
back into Iraq and eventual capitulation. In Qatar Sheikh Hamad was hailed as a war
hero. This consolidated Hamad's power and reputation
as a warrior crown prince in Qatar. After the war he was now in virtual control of the
country whilst his father spent more and more time in Switzerland. In 1995, Hamad launched
a bloodless palace coup against his father. Most Qatari tribes gave their oath of allegiance
to Hamad, although not everyone was happy. A counter coup was launched in 1996 but the
Bedouin tribes paid to cross the border through the desert from Saudi Arabia got lost. So
too did the boat full of French mercenaries, led by Sheikh Khalifa’s former bodyguard,
who’d been training a force of 50 men in the central African country of Chad, only
to be scuppered by landing on the wrong beach. There were later accusations that it was,
in fact, the United Arab Emirates that was behind the plot.
Emir Hamad was seen as something of a reformer. The new Emir began with a reformist zeal that,
according to an Economist article in 1996, had the royal families of surrounding Gulf
states worried. The ministry of information was abolished, paving the way for the establishment
of the Al Jazeera news network, and it was announced that democratic reforms would take
place, with an elected advisory chamber. Women would have the vote; Hamad talked of a British-style
constitutional monarchy where the Emir was head of state but the power resided in an
elected parliament. The exploitation of Qatar gas wealth changed everything. It suddenly
made Qatar, per capita, the richest country on earth.
The country could also count on the protection of US troops. Qatar had historically negotiated
and mediated as a way to survive in a region where it found itself between greater, covetous
powers. The First Gulf War only solidified what smaller nations in the Gulf already knew.
Luckily for Qatar, the Americans also had a problem. American bases were not an option
in Saudi Arabia given hostile local opposition. A solution was found by Emiri Hamad. In 1996
Qatar spent a billion dollars building the Al Udeid air base and invited the US to stay.
After 9/11 the US military moved its regional central command, CENTCOM, to Al Udeid. Just
like with the British in 1916, the Americans would now be the ultimate guarantor for Qatar's
safety. By the turn of the 21st century, Qatar had
been revolutionised from a poverty stricken colonial backwater into a regional powerhouse,
not to mention one of the richest countries on earth. But what would it do for an encore?
Those three seemingly unconnected events – the collapse of the Soviet Union, the post-Hillsborough
formation of the English Premier League and the invasion of Saudi Arabia – had all laid
the foundations for Qatar's next spectacular act.","The transcript provides a comprehensive overview of the geopolitical, historical, and economic factors that have shaped Qatar and its controversial hosting of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. It begins by discussing the various reactions to Qatar's successful bid for the World Cup in 2010 and the controversies surrounding it, including corruption allegations, the poor treatment of migrant workers, and human rights issues in Qatar. The narrative further explores how Qatar's journey to hosting the World Cup is part of broader global currents influenced by historical events dating back to the mid-19th century.",Sportswashing,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar
Cr3d4Oi0Mas,What Happens to the Migrant Workers Who Built the World Cup? | NYT News,"The World Cup in Qatar
is almost over, marking the end of
a 12-year-long nationwide construction project. Hundreds of thousands
of migrant workers converged to help transform
this desert nation, working in difficult
and often dangerous jobs that are also essential
to their livelihood. So what happens to them now? We interviewed more than
three dozen Nepali workers and their families,
some who sent us footage from inside Qatar
at great personal risk. Their stories shed
light on a system that trapped many of them in debt. Those who left Qatar told us
they’re trying to go abroad again. And the workers who are still
there say they need to stay. In the villages of southern
Nepal, many men are absent. Outside of farming, there
are few opportunities to make a living. About a quarter of the
country’s annual income is now earned abroad, and
separation has become routine for many families. Rani’s husband has returned
home just three times in eight years. But he still calls
her every day. The family was in debt
when Rani’s husband left for Qatar. His father was sick, and there
were medical bills to pay. Her husband spoke
to us from Qatar and shared rare
videos of his life. We’re protecting his identity
because he fears retaliation. He says he rarely
takes days off, but the work has paid
off for his family. Ganga Bahadur Sunuwar
has worked abroad for much of his life in
Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and most recently
in Qatar, where he worked at a steel factory. But he got sick
and had to come home. Doctors say he developed
occupational asthma. He now works in Nepal
delivering water. It’s grueling work that’s only
made harder by his medical condition. Ganga Bahadur said he
requested medical leave seven times before he was
allowed to return home because the staffing agency
who hired him illegally held his passport. To work abroad,
first you have to pay recruitment
fees, which are illegal but routine in Nepal. It can cost workers $1,500
to get a job in Qatar. This can mean going
deeper into debt before actually
making any money. Like many workers, Kumar
fears that speaking out may hurt his future
job prospects. We agreed to use a family
name and hide his face. To get a job in Qatar and
cover family expenses, he borrowed money
from a local lender that charged him
36 percent interest. He hoped to earn enough
money to pay it back. But earlier this year,
the company Kumar worked for abruptly stopped
paying thousands of workers. He and his fellow workers
staged a rare protest, blocking the road. Kumar says he and
dozens of others spent more than a
week in jail, and then police escorted them
to their labor camp. The government paid
some back wages and sent them to
their home countries. A Qatari official told us that
the workers left voluntarily, but Kumar says they
didn’t have a choice. At the airport in Kathmandu,
more than 2,000 workers leave every day
for jobs abroad. But for all the
departures, the arrivals are a reminder of the
dangers they may face. These are the remains
of two Nepali workers who died in a
construction accident in Qatar two months ago. Airport officials say three
to four bodies arrive here on average each day, mostly
from the Gulf and Malaysia. Despite the risks
and the sacrifices, most of the workers who spoke
to us say they felt forced to continue, trapped
between poverty and debt and the difficult or dangerous
jobs they just can’t afford to lose.","The transcript discusses the aftermath of the World Cup in Qatar, focusing on the plight of migrant workers who helped in the construction surge driven by the event. The narrative highlights the systemic challenges faced by workers, primarily from Nepal, who are trapped in cycles of debt due to illegal recruitment fees and exploitative labor conditions. These workers contribute significantly to Nepal’s economy, as many income sources in the country are derived from abroad. Stories are shared of individuals like Rani's husband, who, despite rarely taking days off, managed to support his family financially. Another worker, Ganga Bahadur Sunuwar, recounts his struggle with occupational asthma developed due to harsh conditions in Qatar and his subsequent challenges in Nepal. The account exposes how workers like Kumar face severe hurdles such as the illegal withholding of passports, non-payment of wages, and high-interest debts that keep them tied to their jobs. Protests against these injustices have led to detention and forced deportation under claims of ""voluntary"" departures by Qatari officials. The narrative closes by noting the continuous outflow of laborers from Nepal and the somber return of deceased workers' bodies, emphasizing the dire circumstances these migrants endure.",Human Rights Issues,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar

It is framed as a potentially final tournament for football legends like Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, and Luis Suarez. Qatar is the first Arab nation to host the World Cup, introducing many firsts such as a stadium built with the intention of disassembling afterward, and hosting the tournament during winter. The transcript describes technological advancements like cooling systems in stadiums developed by Dr. Saud Ghani of Qatar University, which create a microclimate to keep spectators comfortable amidst the Qatari heat by using eco-friendly air circulation techniques. The Lusail Iconic Stadium, among other stadiums, is emphasized for its capacity and advanced technology. The transcript also covers Stadium 974, noted for being constructed from shipping containers designed for easy disassembly and reuse. The AL Janoub Stadium, designed by Zaha Hadid, reflects traditional Qatari culture and is built to have a reduced capacity post-tournament, with seats intended for donation worldwide. The use of VAR technology with 12 tracking cameras per stadium and advanced match balls is mentioned. Additionally, the state-of-the-art, driverless Metro supporting transport during the World Cup is highlighted.

promise to keith downey in just a moment he is just completing a phone call and after he's completed that phone call he can give us the good news that newcastle fans have been waiting for [Music] very busy today finally the newcastle united supporters have got what they have wanted for a long long time for 18 months of this takeover saga for 14 years of mike ashley stewardship the premier league statement which we've been waiting for all day long has just landed in my my inbox in the last minute i'll read it to you and i'll read every word of it it says the premier league newcastle united football club and james's holdings limited of course that's mike ashley's company have today settled the dispute over the takeover of the club by the consortium of pif pcp capital partners and ruben brothers sports and media company following the completion of the premier league's owners and directors test the club has been sold to the consortium with immediate effect they say the legal disputes concerned which entities uh would own and or have the ability to control the club following the takeover so they say the legal disputes concerned which entities which entities would own and or have the ability to control the club following the takeover but all parties have agreed that the settlement is necessary to end the long uncertainty for fans over the club's ownership the premier league has now received what they say legally binding assurances that the kingdom of saudi arabia will not control newcastle united football club but the consortium will of course which of eighty percent of that is a public investment fund of saudi arabia so they've proved the separation they have those legal documents and they finally say this in the statement the premier league they say all parties are pleased to have concluded this process which gives certainty and clarity to newcastle united football club and their fans so that's a statement that has just dropped in the last few minutes from the premier league that is what we've been waiting for and i suppose that is why everyone has just been that little bit of uncertainty because although newcastle were happy with the deal although we told you half an hour ago the shares had transferred transferred the money had been deposited it still needed to get that rubber stamp from the premier league there it is in black and white from the premier league to say after all this time the takeover has now passed this football club is no longer owned by mike ashley it's now owned by the saudi-backed consortium led by amanda stavley and a new dawn here is in the offing at newcastle united well stay with us keith we're going to work our way through that statement there's a lot there so i'm sure you'll be able to find it on our website skysports.com and across our digital platforms as well but i think it was just over four years ago that amanda staveney came to the first game here at st james's park newcastle united against liverpool just guide us through that timeline and why it's taken so long for that dream she had to be part of a a consortium that bought newcastle to finally getting it over the line in 2021 rob it would take me four years to go to talk about all that that's how long it would take to get through it has been a long long time it really i mean there's been so many twists and turns i stood here in april 2020 last year when we were told an agreement had been reached in principle with the consortium the exact consortium that's in place right now to take over the club 18 months later what then happened as a consortium needed to go through the honours and directors test with the premier league which every takeover does when they got to that stage the premier league wanted further information regarding the consortium they wanted they can sort him to prove separation between the kingdom of saudi arabia and the consortium themselves when that happened on the last day of july last year the consortium walked away and decided they didn't want to be involved in it that looked as though the deal was dead mike ashley rallied behind the scenes he uh he threw the kitchen sink at it i think it'd be fair to say he took the premier league to court on on two different levels we heard from one of them in the cat case last week they were supposed to go to independent arbitration in january um of 2022 so in a few months time he did both of those he brought the saudis back to the table made sure the consortium was still involved and still up for this amanda stavely says that she always was and the takeover since then we've we've heard what's happened with the issues over and beyond sports in the last 24 to 48 hours that's been a massive stream really significant this week the resolution would be in sports and piracy issues hugely hugely and that was that was the main part that they needed to overcome um now that has been overcome and the separation has been proved between the kingdom and south saudi arabia and also the consortium the premier league as they say in their statement there they're happy for it to proceed and all parties are are happy i mean it was interesting we listened to that cat case last week there were a few claims made of that from the premier league by mike ashley's lawyer he said that the premier league throughout the honors and directors test last summer said that they were influenced by the top clubs that came out as as a claim there were certainly other things as well as that played a part in this decision it doesn't say that in the in in the statement here i think as far as newcastle united fans are concerned they just need to concentrate in the future and and try not to worry too much about what's going on in the last 18 months or what's going on in the last 14 years having spoken to the consortium a lot over the last 24 hours particularly today they've got big flat plans for the future huge plans for this football club and hopefully we'll hear some of them in the next couple of hours we're going to talk about them with you in just a moment but let's just bring you a statement from his excellency yasser al ramayan the governor of pif the public investment fund for putting so much of the money behind this consortium that has just bought newcastle united football club uh yasir al-ramayan says we are extremely proud to become the new owners of newcastle united one of the most famous clubs in english football we thank the newcastle fans for their tremendously loyal support over the years and we are excited to work together with them in terms of those plans we've heard that behind the scenes it's been called project zebra this plan to buy newcastle united i can see it's an emotional moment for you actually keith having followed this story for so long um it is not just about improving the playing staff and lifting them away from 19th in the premier league the ground needs a lick of paint the training ground needs improvement there is a lot for this new consortium to get their teeth into here at newcastle i mean it's a huge project and as you say there's so many things that need improvement i think mike ashley would would admit that himself but towards the end he wasn't willing to put the money in to do that the consortium as i'm told are willing to do that you've mentioned many of the things that need upgraded the training ground is probably the main one but what the the consortium want to do is they want to invest in the city they want to invest in the area here around st james's park this stadium over to my right hand side is the cathedral they call it on the on the top of the hill it's a it's a stadium that's in the city center all the pubs and bars surround it this is where the supporters come on a saturday and it's in the city you don't get many you don't get many football stadiums like that these days that form such a huge part of the city the the saudi-back consortium want to be part of that they want to improve their infrastructure they want to spend money um improving other areas surrounding this into the the town centre as well which is just a stone's throw from here those are all of their plans i think more intricate details will come out in the next few hours and hopefully we'll hear from from the consortium um i can add as well and i haven't said this to until this point but the consortium have been here um in in the in the northeast for the last 48 hours now i'm hoping that this deal has been pushed through we thought last night at six o'clock it was going to push through we then thought it'd be 10 o'clock this morning the consortium working behind the scenes desperately trying to get this deal done and they finally got it done now what at 5 15 on on thursday evening i think the newcastle supporters will uh will remember that date i'm just checking the day 7th of october those fans we can see the live pictures of them enjoying the moment enjoying the fact that their football club is now in new hands but you mentioned that it is a long-term project and i guess the importance of tempering caution here that this is not going to be uh an overnight success newcastle won't be lifting the premier league trophy in may that's not what supporters or most supporters think but this is going to be something that needs to be i guess worked on over many years they will feel i hate to be too realistic but what newcastle fans need to realize at the moment is they're in the they're in the drop zone they're in the relegation zone so the immediate priority will for the consortium will be to try and get newcastle up the table and whoever the new manager is that comes in that will be his remit to try and get them up the table yes they'll have money to spend in the january transfer window of course i don't think they're going to throw bucket loads at it straight away they want to do it gradually they say to me they want to do it properly they don't want this to be a flash a flash in the pan um interesting i was watching a program on television the other night about a fever pitch program and it was it was blackburn rovers where obviously they threw so much money in it when they bought all the players alan shearer and graeme was so back at the time and it was a flash in the pan and they struggled after that i think a consortium are aware of situations like that and they don't want to go down that route they want to build it slowly and gradually but staying in the premier league this season is imperative and then building the city building the stadium and everything else that surrounds is obviously is crucial to them and i mentioned that earlier rob i i think the the key thing here is the consortium have shown their commitment to taking over newcastle united by buying this football club while they're in the bottom three of the of the premier league i don't know if that's been done before and they spent 300 million pounds in a premier league club which at this moment in time yes they've only played seven games but are in danger of going out the premier league unless they unless they arrest rest that slide so they've showed their commitment the supporters throughout all of this have shown their commitment and it's about everyone teaming together now to ensure that newcastle united are back up to where the supporters believe they belong and are back up as a major force this will make this will make newcastle united um if they want it to be if the consortium wanted to be one of the one of the richest clubs in the world it was really interesting to hear you use the phrase there the new manager because we must stress that steve bruce is still the man in possession of that job he has been under a huge amount of pressure almost from the very moment he walked through the door i think there was a supporters trust poll that said 94 would be keen for a change of manager i guess that would be a very easy thing for the the new consortium the new owners to do in terms of garnering even more popularity would be to change the manager yeah i mean you know strangely i don't actually think they've fully fully made their decision yet as to when they will look for a new man um i think they will i think they you'd very rarely see a takeover of this magnitude and the consortium or the company come in and don't bring their own manager so i think they will do that um they've got 10 days to do that before the next game against tottenham hotspur which is a week on sunday a game you can see live in sky sports and when i turned up here at eight o'clock this morning there were supporters queuing at the ticket office for tickets for that game and that was before the takeover was through so that kind of sums up that situation um personally i feel for steve bruce a little bit because obviously he's had to work under really difficult circumstances he's not at the money he wanted to spend he wanted to bring him players and transfer deadlines he was unable to and he's cut an ever more frustrated figure hasn't he you have to feel sympathy on a human level for him totally and he's so frustrated because because the supporters are on his back and the supporters are criticizing him but it's been really difficult for him he's not had a lot of money at his um disposal but then the supporters will say about hang on you're saying callum wilson you had joe linton you had these players allen's at maximum and you're still in the bottom three i think steve bruce's job was was probably under he was under pressure anyway even before this takeover superseded that but i do think they'll bring their own man and i must stress and say though that they haven't confirmed that to the state at the stage and he could yet be in in the dugout for the match against tottenham i think it would be unlikely i think they're probably likely to get somewhere in whether it's someone on a temporary basis or who they've got in mind moving forward but i think steve bruce he's been around long enough he knows that it's a new era here and it would be so difficult for him to remain in charge moving forward so i think it's only a matter of time before a new man is announced just a couple more questions then you probably need to get back to your phone and work through a few more things but um firstly i guess the issues and the concerns from outside of newcastle about these new owners obviously one of them has been satisfied from the premier league's perspective this relationship between the state and the ruling family and the pif but the pif's chairman is still the crown prince so there's probably a little bit of an easiness there yeah and the other issue of course is with human rights in saudi arabia and that i guess is is largely possibly being ignored in newcastle would you say because they're desperate for anyone but mike ashley to be in charge of the club but that will be an issue that probably won't go away for the coming year well a key point in this and this is our understanding tonight is that and i think it was mentioned in the statement as well as if it's found that the kingdom of saudi arabia are running the club at any point then the premier league have the power according to that statement and according to legal binding documents they have the power to disqualify newcastle from competition so they have to ensure that the kingdom of saudi arabia are not involved in the running of the club yasser al-ramayan is essentially going to be the chairman of the club he is a high figure at the public investment fund of of saudi arabia and and he will he will essentially take over the running of the club as a non-executive chairman amanda stabley will be the face of the club she's the one that's put everything in the background and uh just looking at my right hand shoulder here and sorry as you can probably hear in the background is what looks like hundreds of newcastle supporters just essentially running around running around to go to a break we'll see in a few minutes time [Music] you,"The transcript details the acquisition of Newcastle United Football Club by a Saudi-backed consortium consisting of PIF (Public Investment Fund), PCP Capital Partners, and the Reuben Brothers. It marks the end of a prolonged 18-month saga linked to Mike Ashley's tenure and the Premier League's approval process. The Premier League has confirmed that although the consortium comprises 80% of Saudi investment, legal assurances guarantee that the Saudi state will not control the club directly. The discussion emphasizes the changes expected at Newcastle United, including infrastructure improvements and potential management changes. The tone surrounding the takeover is optimistic from a footballing perspective, highlighting plans for long-term investment in the team and local community. However, the transcript acknowledges external criticisms about Saudi Arabia's human rights record and suggests potential issues if the Saudi state is found to have undue control. Despite these concerns, Newcastle supporters are described as overwhelmingly positive about the change in ownership after years under Mike Ashley.",Sportswashing,-1,No,Newcastle United ownership,Saudi Arabia
P_5l7dF6kak,Explained: Saudi Arabia’s takeover of Newcastle United,we've had 14 years of being the cheapest club in the league now we're the richest club in the world [Applause] saudi arabia is bringing hope to thousands of football fans in newcastle these were the scenes at st james's park stadium at the first game since newcastle united football club was taken over by a saudi-led consortium fans were over the moon some welcomed their new golf owners with kefirs and white thobes they'd ordered online others settled for throwing a kitchen towel on their heads i think it's absolutely amazing it's fantastic something we needed the team needed everybody needed the fans look you wouldn't get this in manchester us that city man united football we take over the league the cups champions league everything it's a religion basically we live and breathe it anywhere else any investment investment whatsoever in the area is great not just necessary the team yep the whole area is combined but why would saudi arabia pour hundreds of millions of dollars into a football team in northeast england since mohammed bin salman became crown prince in 2017 saudi arabia has invested heavily in sports from heavyweight boxing to wrestling and formula one it's part of the vision 2030 strategy which aims to move the country away from relying on oil it's also an opportunity to improve its reputation abroad meanwhile in newcastle fans felt they had long suffered under the 14-year ownership of mike ashley who they accused of not investing in their team a football heavyweight in the dumps and an oil-rich government looking for a flashy rebrand a perfect union [Applause] saudi arabia is following in the footsteps of its neighbours the uae who bought manchester city in 2008 and qatar who bought paris saint-germain in 2011. both teams are now among the best in the world thanks to the generous injections of cash from their owners now saudi arabia and newcastle want a piece of the pie what people need to realize is that newcastle are forgotten if you say the government or if you live in london it is forgotten about and the city does need investment if you look at the likes of manchester city for example manchester has been completely transformed in the last how many years 10 12 years since they were taken over but like qatar and the uae saudi arabia have been accused of using newcastle to sportswash human rights abuses ever since this deal was first talked about over 18 months ago amnesty has said that it would represent a really high water mark for the saudi authorities in their efforts to clean up their appalling human rights record by buying into top flight english football it seemed that the premier league was going one in one direction on this decision and now they've gone they've gone in another and it's a dangerous precedent that english football is open for business when it comes to sports washing newcastle united's new ownership team have claimed that saudi arabia's public investment fund were separate from the country's rulers we are you know very much our partner is not the saudi state our partner is pif and we look forward to working with them but let's take a closer look at who runs the public investment fund its chair is mohammed bin salman and its board is made up of saudi government ministers and royal advisers and if the newcastle takeover had nothing to do with the saudi royal family these guys didn't get the memo before the first match on the saudi ownership a van was seen driving around the stadium with a picture of jamal khashoggi the journalist murdered by saudi agents in 2018. other local activists have highlighted the war in yemen where a saudi-led coalition has been accused of targeting schools and hospitals killing thousands of civilians that's particularly significant in south shields a small town 10 miles from newcastle and home to some of the uk's first yemenian arab migrants yemeni men first arrived in south shields in the 1860s working as seamen on british merchant vessels some of their descendants previously told us they rejected the saudi takeover of their local club the soldiers who are stationed in most of the forts along hadrian's wall are actually tend to tend to have come from mesopotamia so we have deep and enduring ties to the middle east that a lot of people just don't actually understand or realize those are deep historical roots that bind the northeast to the arab world and the south shield yemen is just one community and when i saw the news my first thoughts turned to them because you know that's one of the biggest communities of yemenis in in the uk and then they're suddenly their football club has been taken over by saudi arabia i mean that you know and i know i know that they've opposed it before and i'm you know if there's any glimmer of hope in in kind of like you know how could the saudi plan backfire it's whether the yemenis and health shields use this as an opportunity to educate people about what's happening in yemen but for most newcastle fans concerns about yemen and saudi human rights have nothing to do with them i think you need to be speaking to the government and saying look what's the issue what are the issues because you've got to remember the uk government do a trade deal or an arms deal with um with saudi arabia so if they can do that sort of deal can why can't newcastle do a deal with a saudi arabian-led consortium for the for their for their club if it passes certain tests which it did last thursday i'm not you know condoning what's happened as a human rights but what we're going to do if we're going to be political about the situation we need to start from the top you know when the saudis come into town you know the queen literally you know rolls out the red carpet the saudis have investment in twitter facebook starbucks your ubers are you going to stop going and using these social medias you're going to stop having a coffee you know we're not going to stop going our football club nothing will stop these newcastle fans from celebrating their newfound saudi world [Applause] [Music] ah [Applause] [Music]

8JjNY_CCosw,Newcastle takeover: £305m Saudi Arabian-backed deal completed - BBC Newsnight,how do you like your football as a vehicle for wider societal change or to campaigning for your taste in recent times what's pretty clear is that for the last 14 years newcastle united's fans haven't liked their football much at all under the ownership of the retail tycoon mike ashley they've complained of under investment and chronic mismanagement and dreamt of his departure this afternoon they got their wish but at what cost fans were celebrating it at james's park today on hearing their clubs been bought by a consortium led by a saudi arabian sovereign wealth fund celebrations of novelty on tyneside with the club languishing perilously close to the bottom of the premier league under ashley newcastle united has been regular gated twice and failed to match its illustrious past these fans hope the multi-million pound investment will turn around fortunes but amnesty international has dubbed the acquisition sports washing of the gulf kingdom's human rights record the premier league says it's had an assurance saudi arabia won't be involved in the running of the club so what do fans make of it all joining me is the chair of the newcastle united supporters trust greg tomlinson greg tomlinson thank you very much for coming on news newsnite um what just explain why the fans first are so supportive of this takeover i think it's 94 said they back it i think you hit the nail on the head when you introduced it um 14 years of mike ashley's disastrous ownership and a real desire to have hope and belief as a football supporter in your club again and that's why we've seen thousands of newcastle fans gathering outside st james park tonight absolutely ecstatic that they think that they can believe and they can believe in their football team again their club again for the first time in a long time so did fans then put winning ahead of a you know any cost i mean this is a regime that brutally murdered the journalist jamal khashoggi so regime where women are second class citizens amnesty international as you heard calls it sports washing and they want the premier league to reconsider is there any discomfort amongst fans over that uh yes absolutely and uh to a point but unfortunately in modern football football clubs are bought and sold by billionaires and sovereign wealth funds the richest people on the planet and in that process football supporters do not get a say we do not get consulted we do not have a decision making well we're not in the conversation so you have to look at that in with that to a point so we we have no say on who buys who sells our football club i'm the chair of the newcastle united supporters trust we are fundamentally obviously against um human rights abuses and we will use that platform if we need to um to educate we held events last year with amnesty international when this deal first broke but how do you think sorry to interrupt i mean how do you think the women's football club the women's supporters the female supporters feel about this um well the the women i've spoken to today including those on the board of the organization that that i represent are absolutely delighted at the end of mike ashley's tenure and are looking forward um here but absolutely you know this is a very complex situation and i think you know it's understandably we take those issues very very seriously but equally we're supporters of a football club i can't just change who i support tomorrow i support newcastle united because i was born in newcastle it's not like i can change it's not like i support a supermarket my supermarket's been bought and i'll change from asda and go and shop at tesco's tomorrow so yeah sorry it's interrupted it's so difficult but we've only got a finite amount of time is there anywhere that you would draw the line is there anyone you'd object to you know if they were promising to invest in the club and the city or is it just that these two things are very distinct for you well i think the the point i'm trying to make here is that the questions and and the the persecution shouldn't be aimed at football supporters the questions should be asked of the government who do deals with saudi arabia for various uh things um to the regulators and to policy makers who who make those decisions if you want to ask those questions they shouldn't be asked to everyday football fans who just want to support their football team who support that football team because of a local allegiance okay so make a prediction what are your hopes your predictions for newcastle based on this new deal champions league trophy in five years do you think what are you hoping for well we will see we just want a football team to be proud of it a club that tries to be to be better every day we've heard amanda stapley one of our owners talk tonight with pride and with ambition and that's the first time we've heard that for around about 14 years greg thomas and thank you very much for coming on news night thank you,"The transcript discusses the recent takeover of Newcastle United Football Club by a consortium led by a Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund. Under the previous owner, Mike Ashley, the club experienced dissatisfaction due to underinvestment and poor management, culminating in the team's relegation from the Premier League twice. The takeover has been celebrated by fans eager for new leadership and investment, despite concerns raised by groups like Amnesty International, labeling the acquisition as sportswashing due to Saudi Arabia's human rights record. The Premier League stated assurances were made that Saudi Arabia wouldn't control the club. Greg Tomlinson, chair of the Newcastle United Supporters Trust, acknowledges the complex situation. While he and many fans are thrilled about the new ownership's potential for success, he admits there is discomfort among fans regarding Saudi Arabia's human rights controversies, including the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Tomlinson emphasizes that fans typically lack a say in ownership changes and that the responsibility for ethical considerations lies with governments and policy makers. He also mentions the lack of alternatives for supporters who identify deeply with their local team. Despite the ethical dilemmas, many fans hold aspirations for the team's improved performance and aim for success, such as eventual Champions League qualification.",Sportswashing,0,No,Newcastle United ownership,Saudi Arabia

Newcastle fans are thrilled at the departure of the unpopular owner Mike Ashley, who is blamed for years of stagnation due to a lack of investment. They view the Saudi-led consortium's acquisition as a promising new beginning for the club. The Premier League was convinced by assurances that the Saudi state would not interfere in daily club operations, with control instead being given to the Saudi Public Investment Fund, despite it being chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. This takeover follows the lifting of Saudi Arabia’s ban on Qatari sports networks, specifically b in Sports, which are integral to the Premier League’s presence in the region. Critics, including Amnesty International, view the acquisition as a case of sportswashing, aimed at improving Saudi Arabia's international image in light of its controversial human rights record, including the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, allegedly ordered by the Crown Prince. The transcript suggests the Premier League's decision poses significant concerns about the potential for sportswashing in English football, reflecting broader ethics issues in globally popular sports.

CtNX1QSztYc,WHY did Newcastle fans welcome Saudi Arabia?,"Newcastle upon time is a city steeped in history from its time as a frontier of the Roman Empire to its leading role in the United Kingdom's Industrial Revolution but nothing represents the city more so than St James's Park perched on a hill north of the river th St James's Park watches over Newcastle it's one of the only Premier League grounds which can be found bang in the Heart of the City we call it the Cathedral on the hill cuz it literally stands above the Hall of the city center here in England's Northeast Newcastle fans cram into this Cathedral to worship their one true love the club is inseparable from the city well there's nowhere else in the UK where it changes the mood um nikasa winning nikasa playing well then the city is jumping great turn what a goal this club exemplifies the warrior heart of North Umbria this is uh what we defend Newcastle United is about unity and adversity after a decade of mismanagement on the pitch and the region reeling from severe budget cuts the tide turned in Newcastle Saudi Arabia bought the club bringing investment and ambition which promised to revitalize the whole city people have really seized on the kind of positive change in fortunes of of the club one of the kind of few causes for Hope and kind of cultural escapism with a renewed purpose and Direction Newcastle look on track to eventually join the top of the football pyramid but alongside the imminent Glory there will always be criticism from detractors about sportswashing about how an autocratic State renowned for its human rights abuses could so brazenly break into one of English football's heartlands going into Newcastle for um for Saudi Arabia or going into Manchester for the UAE it's it's it's brilliant for PR it's brilliant for developing political centers of influence and it's brilliant for developing business interests so how has the Saudi Arabian ownership won over the hearts and minds of Newcastle United fans well it's far from black and white behind the sportswashing narrative there's a tale about local pride and Community Spirit back battling against poverty and unemployment and a government's failure to care for its own people the coastline of north umberland where Newcastle lies has featured heavily in the United Kingdom's stored past Newcastle United is about unity and adversity whether we're being invaded by the Romans the Scots the Vikings or whoever gets HED this club is the modern day manifestation of that the Industrial Revolution elevated the city as a port Town Newcastle became the world's biggest coal Hub with mines shipyards and steel Works dominating the region that era helped to find Newcastle North umberland and the world lots of major kind of uh historic firsts uh took place in Newcastle it had the first electrically lit Street in the world the first modern steam locomotive so there's a sense in which the railways uh kind of originated in in Newcastle but de-industrialization slowly descended across the UK brutal economic policies from Margaret Thatcher particularly decimated the North in the 1980s previously booming industries were gradually wiped out leaving the remaining communities abandoned that moment was a moment that the regions never really recovered from so you have a kind of sense of absence a sense of neglect a sense of marginalization it also had a St politics which began um around about 2010 which have completely taken millions and millions of pounds out of the local economy again um severely um impacting the city the Northeast is now one of the most disadvantaged regions in the UK they lead the nation in child poverty unemployment alcohol related fatalities and suicide rates most of these kind of key sociological measures uh the Northeast is is uh on the wrong side of them so dire is the situation that food banks now prop up the city's most vulnerable it's a common site in much of the United Kingdom but especially in the nation's North Bill Corran founded the Newcastle United fans food bank in 2010 which feeds 1,200 people a week whatever reason people who are working don't have enough money to feed their children nobody stood for power on a policy of starving children so we need to get this sorted out and if they won't sort it out we have to it's no wonder that Newcastle United the city's only football club has become a Haven to escape the harsh realities of Northern life with st james' Park the fabled ground where the fans descend when you come in at the city center you see black and white everywhere you'll go around the corner you'll see a flag then the next Corner you'll see a six seven or eight people start singing and as you get closer and closer the noise starts to develop it's like right come on then who we got today are we going to win come on how boys get in there St james' park has had its moments in the Sun from winning titles in the early 1900s and 1950s to the modern eras of Kevin Keegan and Bobby Robson they may not have won a major domestic trophy since 1957 but these teams brought Joy to the Jordy Nation through Relentless attacking football Newcastle were never the best but they competed they entertained and that's all that mattered when the club was doing well the city was thriving when Kevin Keegan was in charge and there was this Newcastle surged up the league and he would speak to business owners and say productivity increases what Newcastle United does well because everyone bounces into work happy that is your release where you forget about work problems maybe it's financial problems family problems whatever it is that was your release until that is a big man with big plans decided he wanted a pce of the pie when retail magnet Mike Ashley bought the club in 2007 everything appeared Rosy he invested in the team made big promises and even drank pints with the fans but a series of off field blunders resulted in Newcastle being relegated twice from the Premier League in seven years the fans turned against Ashley seeing him as yet another member of a powerful Elite who neglected the Northeast some Newcastle fans maybe subconsciously almost made that connection between Mike Ashley and that Elite as well that They Don't Care About Us this is all about money for m asy just as we all forgotten about financially in other terms Ashley tightened the pur strings as he put the club up for sale attempts to kickstar a fanf funded takeover fell flat and many of the Jordy faithful finally turned their backs on their beloved Club people go to watch football because it's a passion they enjoy it it's an Escape and it wasn't any of those things under Mike Ashley he was sucking the enjoyment out of that under Ashley there was just no direction whatsoever the club was stable financially um but it was more a business model and a an advertising platform for Ashley with there's nothing worse than turning up every game knowing that you know it's just going nowhere it got to a stage where by fans weren't angry anymore or they were angry but just they didn't have the the feeling to be able to keep going to matches and keep protesting against the club content and despair created a toxic atmosphere and presented a ripe opportunity for one of the world's richest and most autocratic states to sweep in and take over in October 20121 Saudi Arabia under the guise of its public investment fund bought Newcastle United for £300 million following a complicated legal battle with the Premier League the football world was shaken autocratic States had already crept into the game but never before was there so much blowback against foreign investment within football sportswashing Frontline the criticism Saudi Arabia's deao ruler Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman was in the Limelight due to the murder of journalist Jamal kogi Saudi Arabia does provide probably the most obvious example of of why you might get involved in sport he had a huge reputational problem at the same time as he was trying to diverse his economy and bring a lot of investment into the country um now he needed somehow to get out of the the problem he was in and sport was a great way to do that so it's not about getting rid of the bad news smothering that bad news with vast amounts of of good news Newcastle fans took to the streets the hasht can spread through the fan base on social media as supporters cracked open beers to celebrate the long awaited departure of Mike Ashley there's a lot of people who who criticize the Newcastle fan response to the Saudi takeover but I don't think anyone would have criticized him for wanting to get rid of of Ashley and to to have celebrated that at the time we celebrate like we win a trophy and when the take of us announced outside teams park that is one of the highlights of my life supporting the club for over 25 years Newcastle fans didn't choose Saudi Arabia that decision lay firmly at the feet of the Premier League and even the UK government under Boris Johnson which was found to have played a crucial role in lobbying for the Saudi deal to be rubber stamped it was determined that the public investment fund was a separate legal entity to the Saudi State even though it is Saudi owned and funded and chaired by Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman I think when you look at the evidence that's been amassed on that there's no question the British government was actively trying to push that deal through Johnson was very public and critical of the Premier League ostensibly about transparency but really what he was trying to do was um was pressure the Premier League to approve the sale almost the whole city was desperate for Newcastle United to be under new ownership and the promise of saudy money flowing into other parts of the economy was too good to turn down there was no other buyer who was going to come in at that price and was going to promise the investment that they did and therefore that's why they would supported given the potential investment for the city the potential benefit for the city and hopefully its residents as well I mean the city is hugely deprived it needs external investment because it's not coming from the UK government you can entirely understand why the simple thing for an MP to do is to really get behind that bid and to close your eyes a little bit away from the the more unsavory dimensions of the Saudi regime it was an open goal for the new Saudi owners who were also extremely astute when picking the right allies as minority shareholders the ruin Brothers billionaires who already held big investments in the city and Amanda stavely who had built her career broke ing deals for Middle East investors provided the perfect front I don't think the role that Amanda stavely played in the Takeover and since can really be understated um having a a White English woman as the face of the Takeover someone who knew all the things to say to supporters was critical not only that but I think she was very Adept in her engagements with the media she has been a nice diversion away from the real power behind the club which is Muhammad B Sal most fans didn't take much to be convinced either the Saudis invested in the squad renovated the training facilities proposed a Stadium expansion and announced plans to develop the land around St james' Park which Ashley had either sold off or allowed to wallow in dilapidation they've also poured cash into the women's team which was languishing in the fourth tier during Mike Ashley's Reign they now aim to be competing in Europe by 2027 that's another controversial element because you get some people who say Saudi ownership given women's rights in Saudi Arabia should they be invested in the women's team the counter argument to that is well is it such a Negative to invest in the women's team here it was a forgotten about entity in theast United it was not even part of the club before they came in perhaps most importantly however the club reestablished a relationship with the fans and they started winning under Eddie how Champions League qualification followed for the first time in 20 years to get Champions League after 2 years like it's incredible how we're fighting against the Elon you know for Newcastle be competing you know absolutely battered Paris 4-1 who would have thought that BPP is walking around stru himself all miserable see in park what a [Applause] [Music] sight to understand the Jordy fanaticism when it comes to Newcastle United you have to join them on an away day 15,000 of them descended on Dortmund for a Champions League match intent on soaking up every minute of being back in Europe it's crazy I think two year ago we were fighting a relegation battle it's a lot of money to follow Newcastle United you're talking we are literally right in the Northeast we've got the furthest to travel and we spending hundreds and hundreds every game but it's worth it for that little bit of kick here in Germany however there's not a lot of love for newc owners the fans are warmly welcomed in Dortmund but the club's ownership possibly the purest example of the plight of modern football doesn't sit right in Germany fans have an active say in how their Club is run thanks to the 50 plus1 ownership model think the reality is that Germany is light years ahead of England and has a far more sustainable and far better model that represents genuinely the interest of fans and communities and clubs Dortmund may not have as much money and therefore the ability to keep up with Premier League finances but their fans wouldn't have it any other way the German model is all but impossible in England any dream of fan ownership is long gone unless there's a massive overhaul of the footballing system from the top down Qatar is the latest autocratic state to be linked to a premier league buyout but what happens when these ownership models decide to jump ship or even forced out a lot of fans around Europe will look at Newcastle or look at Manchester City and say that's great I want that money for my club but what what about when geopolitical Dimensions or geopolitical events change what about when they suddenly decide they don't want those clubs anymore what happens then for now Newcastle United fans are just basking in the reality of once again being competitive a feeling like they've won back a connection to their beloved football club but the issue of being owned by an autocratic State renowned for human rights abuses can't be ignored me as someone who lives in the area grew up in the area the now intrinsic association between Newcastle United and Saudi Arabia is something I find to be deeply uncomfortable but at the same time it isn't Newcastle United fans who decided who the owner was a lots of Newcastle fans have lots of different opinions about the Saudi ownership and the relationship with it a minority have walked away entirely some have fully embraced the Saudis while many are torn I think we can learn a lot but it's it's a difficult one because there is some atrocious crimes that do happen but as a fan base we were aware of it but our focus is football and going support our club also at the heart of the issue is a governing body and a national government that doesn't have football fans best interests at heart football clubs are incredibly important to the communities that they serve and they should be Community institutions representing fans representing communities and they can be vehicles for for social justice but when they're used in this way um that they they serve some completely other purpose of a dictator thousands of miles away doesn't care about Newcastle doesn't care about the people in Newcastle doesn't care about football in Newcastle the fans believe they are back in control claiming that they've finally got their Club back but is that truly the reality I think the new owners have been very smart in the way that they have engaged with the supporters and and certainly I've tried to give them the sense that they do have ownership over the club now I think that's very superficial um I think the reality is their Club has probably never been further detached from them it shows just how difficult it is to completely abandon a club that you followed for an entire lifetime what they want is a football team they can connect to a football team they can believe in go and watch and enjoy and they haven't had that for so long so both solidarity hard work friendship humor uh dignity um I don't think we're that bothered about winning things we've been so long without it that we really don't know what it's like like you never know one day we might lift a trophy and that's that's I mean there'll be scenes there'll be scenes if we lift a trophy those scenes will always be associated with the Saudi State whether Newcastle fans like it or not that's now the Stark reality of modern football in a globalized [Music] [Music] world","The transcript explores the deep connection between Newcastle United Football Club and the city

Human rights groups have condemned this involvement, citing a United Nations report that implicates Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Despite the Premier League stating they have received assurances that Saudi Arabia will not control Newcastle United, Khashoggi's fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, claims these assurances are false and expresses her disappointment in the ownership, labeling it as problematic given the alleged involvement of a murderer. The transcript describes human rights issues in Saudi Arabia, highlighting severe conditions for women, LGBT individuals, and the general routine use of the death penalty. The notion of sportswashing is emphasized, as amnesty groups argue that it is farcical for individuals involved in war crimes to buy influence in English football.

kMI_HucvbUU,Saudi-led takeover of Newcastle appears to be back on,we are going to start tonight with the big story behind me and a breakthrough in this long-awaited takeover bid of newcastle united by a saudi-led consortium it's all because the saudi state have resolved their issues with being sport over illegal streaming of premier league football in the country now what we know is that the deal still needs premier league approval but significant progress has been made on this deal which would end mike ashley's ownership of newcastle united now the prospective takeover has been ongoing hasn't it for a long time 18 months in fact but it's believed that an agreement could be reached very soon indeed we've got a live with keith downey coming up soon as well he's at st james's park for us and we will be getting reaction here on sky sports news to this story as well but let's just take you through the timeline mike ashley's been owner of newcastle for around 14 years he took over back in 2007. now ashley rarely speaks publicly but in one of the few interviews during his time as owner he revealed he'd not stand in the club's way if a potential buyer attempted to purchase the club and it had to be the right potential buyer as well right let's get live to st james's park as promised uh this has been a very busy man this afternoon it's mr keith downey who's up in the northeast uh keith thanks so much for coming on live this evening tell us what is the very latest you can yeah pete thanks very much uh welcome to james's park this evening where there is a growing belief that this takeover led by amanda stavely and backed by the wealth of the sovereign wealth fund of saudi arabia is close to being pushed through and that is because as i heard you alluding to just a moment ago developments today in the saudi state where they resolved their issues with the sports broadcaster uh being sports over the illegal streaming of premier league football matches in their country that's something that's been going on for the past four years being sports essentially has been banned in saudi arabia and its cost being sports who have of course links to the premier league is one of their official broadcasters it's cost them money and that has been resolved today which was a big hurdle regarding this takeover it's my understanding that there are further hurdles that are still to be craw across but it's a big development in this takeover story a takeover story which you only know too well has dragged on for a long time now some 18 months we've been talking about the uh the consortium led by amanda stapley potentially taking over here at newcastle united as we stand here on wednesday evening at nine o'clock it looks to be a big step closer to finally being completed yeah it's been an incredible day hasn't it following developments and hearing what we have throughout the day but still we we have to find out where we are at this moment in time and look back at last time keith when this all fell apart and was halted what went wrong then what's different this time and what still needs to happen in order for this to finally be pushed through this time around yeah well they still they still need premier league approval the consortium and that's what we're waiting for this wednesday evening that's something we need to remember as well that the consortium needed last summer it was the thing that held the deal up they wanted to they can sort him to prove separation between themselves and the saudi state the consortium were unwilling unable to do that at the time and you remember the last day of july last summer the consortium walked away mike ashley brought them back to the table in the hope that a deal can be struck of course he's taken the premier league to court there's that arbitration case lined up for the first week in january we found out last week during uh the second part of his attack on the premier league we found out that it's been um booked in for the third of january the first week in january but if this deal is to be struck in the in the coming days in the coming weeks in the coming hours whenever that may be it would mean that arbitration is no longer required and that was the thing that we felt was holding up this deal so it'll be interesting to see what happens uh in the immediate future and the medium-term future but certainly this evening the takeover of newcastle united to take over the supporters of all wanted 300 million pound takeover by that saudi-backed consortium is a very very big step closer to finally happening keith you know what it's like to walk around the streets of newcastle you must get asked this question all the time about where we are in the takeover i think it's four years actually since uh amanda stavely first status in james's park and there's been speculation ever since how will the newcastle fans be feeling this evening knowing how close this one is pete i've been doing this job in the northeast as a northeast reporter for eight years eight years ago last week i took over in this role for four years i've been talking about this potential takeover as i speak to you just now just over behind my camera there's a number of cars that have come up to park up and find out what we're seeing this evening that because they are desperate for this takeover to go through i think it has to be tempered though i'm quite conservative when it comes to whether this will go through or not and that is because we have been here before we were here last summer uh last april it was when we thought the deal was set to be ratified by the premier league we didn't see the issues with the owners and directors test and the consortium coming we're back here again when it looks as though it's close for the supporters it's all they want their supporters voted on the newcastle united supporters trust in the last 48 hours saying they wanted the manager to go i think the thing they want bigger than anything is this takeover to happen because mike ashley's been at this club for 14 years he doesn't want to be in charge of it anymore he's happy to hand over the reins to someone else he thought he had a deal with the saudis for 300 million pounds last year and that is why he has been so insistent in trying to revive those talks over the last 18 months the supporters want something to believe in they want a new challenge they want the club to be challenging at the topic again they feel right now that they're just existing in the premier league and trying to stay in that league year after year to ensure that the premier league money comes in year after year so they will be excited this evening but have to temper their excitement and say there are still a few hurdles that need to be um gone over and of course we said that last summer and it didn't happen the consortium walked away and but i must say this does feel a lot more tangible tonight and it does feel as though finally this long-running 18-month saga this 14-month tenure of mike ashley here at newcastle united is close to being over and just the final question keith the reason why people are turning up there right now this evening and the reason why so many people are contacting you know yourself and sky sports news official account on on twitter this evening and so on and social media is they want to know how close we are now some suggestion there was going to be an announcement tonight we don't expect that do we but how close is this as we stand here this evening yeah i mean that's the question everyone wants to know they just want to know is the takeover happening and if it is happening when is it happening i'm afraid we can't give an answer to that it's a very um delicate um situation a difficult situation there's lots of things that need to be addressed sorted out and i think the newcast united fans have to be patient i feel bad asking them to say be patient given what they've had to go through as i say for the last 18 months them desperate for this takeover to happen i don't expect anything to be announced tomorrow but certainly with the developments today over in saudi arabia and that agreement now in place with b in sports it feels that that is a huge step closer to this takeover finally being pushed through and the newcastle united supporters will get what they what they finally want okay keith downey thank you so much for now well let's take you back to through some of the facts and figures then and in total newcastle united have spent 486.4 million pounds on transfers since mike ashley took control of the club back in 2007. they've received just over 350 million pounds in the same time that's given them a net spend of just under 130 million pounds in ashley's regime that's around 10 million a year isn't it more or less in ashley's time at the club they've had 10 permanent managers from sam allardyce all the way through to steve bruce they've been relegated from the premier league twice but they bounced back at the first attempt on both occasions and the average finishing position in the premier league during his tenure has been 13th highest of which was when they finished fifth under alan pardue back in 2011 2012. [Music],"The transcript discusses the potential takeover of Newcastle United by a Saudi-led consortium, which is nearing completion following a resolution between Saudi Arabia and the sports broadcaster beIN Sports. The conflict involved illegal streaming of Premier League games, a significant hurdle for the takeover. The deal, which has been in the works for 18 months, depends on Premier League approval, a point of failure in previous negotiations due to concerns over the separation between the consortium and the Saudi state. Mike Ashley, the current owner of Newcastle for 14 years, has been seeking to sell the club, and the fans are eager for this change, hoping it will end their prolonged period of underachievement. Despite the positive developments, caution is advised as past attempts have fallen through. The financial details of the Mike Ashley era are reviewed, showing substantial spending and net costs on transfers, numerous managerial changes, and fluctuating Premier League standings.",Sportswashing,0,No,Newcastle United ownership,Saudi Arabia

It humorously compares the case of Louis Tomlinson, a singer from One Direction, who was blocked from taking over Doncaster Rovers, to the hypothetical scenario of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, implicated in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, passing the test. This scenario is portrayed as illogical and potentially humiliating for regulatory bodies.

svMZFJf_DDo,Newcastle takeover: Mike Parry defends the Saudi investment,i have to overlook the politics and the way that countries are run when they come to invest in football in this country because if you suddenly started to examine the record of all the countries that are now investing in football in the premier league and the championship in this country you'd have to scrap them all as owners because they've all got problems domestically my view is that you have to look away from the domestic policies of the countries who invest here because if you examine them too closely the standards by which they run their society are very different to the standards by which we run ours so i'm afraid if we're going to accept their money we have to accept that they run their country a different way to us i love the investment that comes in i love the business relationship with saudi arabia and i for one would say you have to compartmentalize the relationship between investment between business football and the politics at home of the countries who invest here,"The transcript discusses the need to separate politics and domestic policies of investing countries from their investments in football within the UK. It suggests that if one were to scrutinize the domestic records of countries investing in the Premier League and the Championship, none would qualify due to various internal issues. The speaker believes that accepting investment requires accepting that these countries operate under different standards than those in the UK. They express appreciation for the business relationship with countries like Saudi Arabia, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing between investment and political matters.",Sportswashing,1,No,Newcastle United ownership,Saudi Arabia

r_cSRwCdnsk,Mark Dolan gives his take on a Saudi Arabia-backed Newcastle United takeover,19 premier league clubs are up in arms about the sale of mike ashley's newcastle united to saudi investors i wonder if some of these clubs complaining now are the ones who disgracefully tried to destroy the premier league with a breakaway super league and i wonder whether these are the same multi-billion pound organizations who themselves have attracted investment from sometimes less than conventional sources what about the takeover of manchester united by the glazer family who immediately loaded this great club previously in the black with hundreds of millions of pounds worth of debts what about chelsea fc whose owner roman abramovich was unable to secure a british passport because the government sought assurances about how he made his money in the end he withdrew the application no business can turn its back on other countries for investment and no country can turn its back on the world especially post-brexit britain we do huge amounts of business here in the uk with saudi arabia and i guess in an ideal world we wouldn't but we don't live in an ideal world we do business with russia and china too to seek to overturn this much-needed investment in a fabulous cub club and a brilliant city isn't just misguided unfair and wrong it's deeply hypocritical too i wonder whether these self-same chairmen of premier league clubs will be boycotting the next world cup in qatar where human rights abuses our legion and where hundreds of immigrant workers fell to their deaths or died of dehydration building the stadia in which premier league fat cats will be hoovering up prawn cocktail sandwiches in the end this investment is a vote of confidence in the uk and in the most watched sporting league on the planet the english premier league the premier league is a fabulous global product and everyone wants a piece of it back of the net arguably the success of the english premier league with its foreign investments and its remarkable diversity of talent on the pitch should be a template for global britain if you really have a problem with saudi money perhaps the board of man city would like to return sheikh mansour's billions and go back to the bad old days of fighting relegation and living in the shadow of manchester united well it's not going to happen this investment is brilliant news for newcastle united football club and i hope it brings the long-awaited footballing glory that that club and that city so richly deserve bring on this investment and hawaii the lads,"The transcript discusses the controversy surrounding the sale of Newcastle United to Saudi investors, highlighting the perceived hypocrisy of other Premier League clubs opposing the investment while they themselves have histories of controversial financial dealings. The speaker criticizes clubs for attempting to block Saudi investments, suggesting it is hypocritical given their own financial backgrounds, such as Manchester United's debts post-Glazer takeover and Chelsea's owner Roman Abramovich's issues acquiring a British passport. The argument extends to the broader geopolitical and economic relationships, mentioning the UK's extensive trade with Saudi Arabia, Russia, and China. The transcript defends the Saudi investment as a positive move, labeling it as a vote of confidence in both Newcastle United and the English Premier League. It suggests that foreign investment has been a key factor in the league's global success. Additionally, it points out the inconsistency of Premier League chairmen who might criticize Saudi investments yet are likely to attend the World Cup in Qatar despite its human rights record.

kS1wVgl1xSw,Newcastle fans celebrate as Saudi takeover finalised,yeah i mean the takeover debate has been going on for about nearly four years really um newcastle united fans become very frustrated about the fact it's stalled that the premier league seemingly were content to say nothing and they wouldn't give them any updates on whether it could ever go through the saudi investment fund actually walked away at one point so frustrated were they by the process but newcastle knight had never gone away clearly mike ashley the owner who sold has clearly stayed in contact with them believing a deal could be made eventually and today's the day it has been and a lot newcastle united fans are very very happy about it understandably because for many many years they've been starved of success uh the club has been in limbo really you would say uh just content to take over there's a song about the fact that newcastle night just ticks over and it's worth much much more than that it's a much bigger club than that it deserves success and it's been unable to get going really kick itself into gear and now it can it's finally got over the line because the uh saudi the saudis have convinced the premier league that the government will not be involved in any part of running the case united that was very significant because the crown prince is perceived to have been involved in human rights violations not the least of the killing of a journalist which has caused i mean is causing great disquiet with amnesty international um and it is a serious it was a serious concern also the piracy issue which is that uh be in sport who operate out the middle east and have the rights to uh uh broadcast the premier league they um they highlighted the fact that saudi arabia were broadcasting illegally on uh illegal boxes um to to their whole nation uh they felt well the premier league also felt that this shouldn't be done that it was robbing the premier league of much needed revenue it was robbing b in sports of revenue they complained and to be honest clubs could never the other clubs in the premier league couldn't really sanction this takeover while that illegal act was going on saudis have given guarantees that that issue will now be settled that they will pay compensation for that and that from now on they will broadcast premier league football legally and also as i say they will not get involved in the running of newcastle football club it's massively exciting for newcastle fans especially as they've been starved to success for so long those who um of an elder generation which is me i'll count myself a newcastle newcastle fan which i am um i've never seen newcastle win a domestic trophy you have to go back to 1955 for the last time newcastle won a trophy in this country 1969 for its last significant trophy which was a european first cup and it's been in stagnation probably since the john hall era john hall gave newcastle united fans a lot of hope when he bought the club they very nearly won the league didn't happen had some great champions league nights and that gave newcastle fans a taste for what was possible at the club now they've got that taste again and for people to criticize the fans saying you know they shouldn't be encouraging the saudi money well there are a lot of other clubs who have owners who come from the middle east who you could maybe raise questions about as well uh it's understandable that newcastle fans are now excited because for far too long they've been it's been a dormant club we've forgotten what it was like to be excited about the team and now there's reason to be excited about going to watch the team uh going to watch hopefully new players better players players that can take them back to the top end of the table and maybe to compete in europe newcastle united fans are certainly talking about all sorts of possibilities there are a lot of jokes going around about the fact newcastle are going to sign killian and bappe available on a free transfer from january i think that might be pushing things a little bit but certainly opens up new possibilities around around europe for some of the for some of the best players yes you have to abide by financial fair play the very fact that the club commands even in poor times can command a 52 000 53 000 crowd means it can raise revenue very very quickly and you can justify big spending very very quickly um so the hope is that that's going to happen and it'll be a prosperous a prosperous season after next possibly first of all this season they've got to get a immediate threat of relegation everybody assumes that will be simple but they can't even you know they can't buy players till january so there's still another few months where they'll be fighting against the odds but they hope it gives you the fact that the crowd instead of being on the players backs perhaps and maybe on the manager's backs now has hope will hopefully inspire them anyway away from the drop zone i think for steve bruce it's now going to be very difficult to stay in the job i mean it's quite hard beforehand but he knew that while this whole nonsense was going on that mike ashley wasn't really going to change him now with new investment i will be surprised if the new owners support him they will probably look to get a new manager a manager of european pedigree and steve's been fighting with one hand behind his back but also with the with the fans on his case they didn't want him um he's he he is a newcastle fan whatever whatever people say he is big newcast fan it is a job he wanted but it's become a very very difficult situation for him now um he's supposed to be having his 1000th game a week on saturday i'll be very surprised if he gets to that uh it'll be amazing if he does but i don't think he i don't think he will there's certain managers available around europe such as antonio conte who would be you know pretty amazing appointment for newcastle all sorts of names are going to be thrown at it but you would expect them to make to make that change probably pretty soon you,"The transcript discusses the long-anticipated takeover of Newcastle United by the Saudi Investment Fund. Newcastle fans are excited about this change, as the club has experienced a prolonged period of limited success. The previous owner, Mike Ashley, maintained negotiations with the Saudis, hoping for a successful conclusion. The Premier League had previously stalled the takeover due to concerns about Saudi involvement in club management and issues like piracy related to broadcasting rights. The Saudis have assured the Premier League that they will not be involved in club management and will address the piracy concerns by compensating and adhering to legal broadcasting practices.",Sportswashing,0,No,Newcastle United ownership,Saudi Arabia
1c3BSJHffI0,Newcastle United fans react to potential Saudi Arabia £300m takeover outside St James' Park,don't really know to be honest it hasn't quite sunk in like for 14 years it's kind of been just a depressing skeleton of a club before it would finally be at the end of it now it's just it genuinely hasn't actually sunk in yet it's exciting it's nervous um it's not so much about the saudis coming in it's more about actually leaving for me um it's taking me nephew to school and not seeing any newcastle tops in the playground anymore or picking them up from football and seeing kids running around in like kids from london or from paris it's trying to bring it back to just seeing black and white tribes you look around and this is what it was like when i first started coming and i my nephew said they used to get bullied for saying he supports newcastle he lives two and a half miles from the stadium if we're doing so this time he'll never go through you want to see the scarf doing it you want to see them holding the scarf looking over the top looking over the east stand here's where i see the club staying with a picture of the corner flag that's the only reason that's yeah that's a bit that you young kind of most looking forward to we've been here before um it does seem a little bit different um but it's nice just to have hope even if it all falls through it's we've had hope and it's something that we haven't had in 14 years i think what from the last 24 hours is more exciting than anything i've had in the last decade bruce um communicate i don't think there's any one thing that we need just transparency and communication whether it's on a new manager a director of football cleaning that um just transparency um i don't really care what it is as long as we know what's going to be going on suck bruce because if he's the longer he's yeah the less chance we have a steel because if he it's pointless heaven than you would know if you're not going to bring in your manager with him because that he's just not good enough at all i think every journey here is ecstatic over the moon well almost almost over the moon almost we've got that little little tiny feeling that i might not go through but i think everyone's almost over the hedge now and just buzzing for this takeover happening all right probably just a new new management just a whole new structure how the club's gonna be ruined and personally i would love to see um obviously we need we need better players to stay up that's probably the best thing but i would love to see just improvements in the uh our facilities like um train facilities in our medical facilities and all of that i think i think it's a lot like i think it's that one that's what we want that's that's all we've ever cared about getting our club back i think ever since mike actually put the club up officially for sale we would have took anyone who would have told anyone that had the money would just please just get mike ashley at the club um obviously the money that's being thrown around that we keep hearing about is it's it's astronomical it sounds it sounds amazing and no one's going to turn that down everyone everyone's buzzing for that being in the in the tune but um i think first objective is to get to get the man out of the club and just have new owners new hope i'm delighted that the sale finally seems like it's going to go through we've waited over 18 months all we've wanted is to see a successful newcastle united i've only known mike ashley's era so for 14 years we're going to every new season with no hope no ambition just hoping that we're going to steal and finally we'll have the hope that we can go on and challenge for better things and we won't have to worry about relegation every year i think it seems like right now the limits are endless i think it'll be a slow process i think it's definitely something that won't happen overnight you've got to build try and steady the ship first get a squad that's capable of being in and around mid table without worrying about relegation and kick on from there but i certainly think within the next maybe five years we can challenge for trophies which we've lacked for so long i think the first plan should be um definitely to sort out the managerial situation because i don't think steve bruce can take us any further now i think he's struggling and i think if he stays here we will unfortunately make the drop,"The transcript captures the sentiments of Newcastle United fans regarding the Saudi-led takeover of the club. After 14 years of what many fans describe as a dismal period under Mike Ashley's ownership, there is a wave of excitement and hope among supporters for a new beginning. The takeover is seen as a potential revitalization of the club, with expectations of new investments, better management, and improved facilities. Fans express eagerness for transparency and communication from the new owners, as well as a restructured club with better management and players. Despite skepticism about whether the takeover might face hurdles, there is optimism that with the new financial backing, Newcastle United could improve from its previous struggles, avoid relegation, and possibly compete for trophies in the future.",Sportswashing,0,No,Newcastle United ownership,Saudi Arabia
crhO6qOxQEI,SAUDI ARABIA’S PIF NEWCASTLE UNITED TAKEOVER - THE DEVELOPMENT ON THE CITY !!!!!,six months ago one of the biggest days in the cast night is history as our takeover was finally complete the saudi arabia pair amanda slavery we are the richest team currently in world football but in those six months watch change in newcastle and what's changed the people in newcastle will spill that's what we got to try and explain this video all the benefits that newcastle as the city and its population take from this and how huge it is going forward but you guys are new to the channel make sure i get down there hit that subscribe button if you want to keep it over there all sorts of this news all you've got to do is hit that button and it will pop up but yeah anyway though not being around the bush let's get into it as you can see guys in coney inside lisa's park now we're going to begin off this video by talking about people's mental health and people's physical health how does newcastle's take over factor in all that so mental health we begin off with that now newcastle is a working class that you saw a lot of people in this city will work to actually ask us off throughout the week to make sure they can go to the games in the weekend they'll spend that hard-earned money to watch newcastle play so newcastle's performances on the pitch can massively dictate how some of the moves will feel throughout the week if they cast a win you're happy if the castle loses you're sad it's just like any old football club you lose a game you'll be deflated now personally with me the first couple of days after the loss it can hit quite hard depending on how the loss happens i think yeah one for example we lost one note against a team that really is terrible they just feel bad next couple days like how do we lose that game you just you're not motivated to get out of bed and do something you're not motivated to grow outside get some exercise done you're just not motivated to do that and volunteer for a child for example get involved with community work you're not motivated to do that when your football team loses because you just you just feel down so personally for me and the castle's performances on the pitch really do factor into how people's health is and they take oh i just massively boosted everyone's health because we were a stagnated club for 14 years we had no ambition no feature the club wasn't going anywhere we were just almost like a yo-yo club would be honest we just we were just surviving the skin of our teeth seasoning season it wasn't going anywhere there was no there was nothing to the club it was just so crap and now we got this take all we have a clear path to go on we have a clear trajectory we have season ambitions that we have levels we want to get to with every single castle team which is really important we'll tell you about your team shortly but the main part here is that people as a result would be more motivated to get out of bed and do something that's what this club can do behind me guys is the most iconic pub in newcastle the strawberry when you think of pubs in the castle you always think of that one it's been here since 1859 and he has a fact for you actually within a half mile radius in james's park there is 108 pubs to go to that is the most out of any team in england being in the center any castle is quite big for the community now with the stadium get more and more fans in due to the takeover the first woman's match was played here on sunday that's more opportunities for these businesses to make money whether you're eating whether you drink water maybe you'll always go to these places and in the local community that just generates more revenue which is huge now if newcastle were playing european football he had a long cup run again that is more matches that people will attend when the castle win matches people will go out after the game and drink more in the pubs a very occurring thing that you were seeing this video is that performances on the pitch matter and you do and with new owners now with required direction where we want to go we will be striving to get more wins under a previous owner that wasn't the case we would make the same sufficient enough and we didn't care as long as we stayed whereas now we have a clear direction and we are pushing to be more than just a team that stays up back in my favorite spot guys upstairs in rosie's bar now we're going to talk about charities and how the club since the takeover has linked really well with charities we're going to talk about the women's team as well because believe it or not they're also run by a child so it's going to be quite interesting they talked about the difference has made since the takeover and how things have really went well but anyway we're going to be getting off with the food bank so the acts in james's park every single match week 10 pound donation will feed a family for one week now jamie rubin he doubles the amount every single match rig saw let's say the food bank raises about eleven thousand pounds in a matrix jerry rubin would then pay eleven thousand pounds himself so actually will be twenty two thousand pounds that's massive because one it feeds a lot more people until it encourages more people doing it when you donate on a match day you know your money is going to be doing so let's say i donate 10 pounds i know 20 pounds actually go to charity which is a great incentive for money casa fans to donate to the food bank it's sad to live in an age where we actually need a food bank but it's really good to see the club integrate themselves with it now i did an interview with bill from the women's match you haven't seen that vlog make sure i watch it it gives a really good insight into the actual process of the food bank now one thing he said actually is that the club gave away free tickets to people that used the food bank for the women's match some people might go or who cares it's only three pound but the fact is the club went out to its way to give tickets to people that use the food bang boom never been to james's part before they let him watch the women's team 22 000 people watch that woman's match that is so good going for the woman's team now i don't want to slack the club off yeah but the treatment of the women's team hasn't been good enough under a previous owner the foundation plays a huge part actually running the club and the players that have battled footballs get their own kits in it really the club was just neglected it's only reporting the woman's team was heavily neglected but it wasn't for the foundation that would have been screwed so now under a new ownership amanda steele made sure they were placing james parker's scene she went out of her way made sure it would happen and 22 thousand newcastle fans backed that team now girl was going this in james's park they can now picture themselves playing there one day they would have been players there that in 15 years time were actually players in james park people are that just watching the game dreams were made true on sunday and more dreams will be made true in the future because this club wanted equality and they actually went out its way to make sure girls played there and going forward now it's so good to see the club actually really care about its people it didn't happen to it but it went out of the way to do so anyway and again as i said before that's more money generated and more income for local communities as well as businesses it's so good for the club all around and i'm really looking forward to see how the women's team progresses within the next couple of seasons cheers cody in the outdoor area she was born now she was just one of many visible changes that has happened since the takeover it was named she was born the first fish it should have never changed it's great to see it back to shooters bar now though and fans going into it can just remember the iconic striker that this ball was named after in the first place so it still needs to be a bit of work to do the insider thing is or a shirt or for example but one step over time i'm quite happy with it now as i'm currently recording this video that actually started to dig up the cloud the where shua statute is gonna get moved to so it's really good to see the club working behind the scenes getting this stuff done as quickly as possible the reason why i'm standing here is because we're going to talk about the case staff members now so in february this year it was announced that they will be paying their staff members above the minimum wage so staff members will be paid at least nine pound 90 now which is great to see it shouldn't have took this long but that's not amanda stevie's fault and it's great to see that she cares about the workers regardless of how big of a goal they claimed football club she treats everybody and it's just fascinating to see as well as that though and had a christmas part your mind this thing you just went in just met all the staff members one's behind the ball working at the club shop just meets like a normal human being it's just incredible to see she's not condescending she's extremely down to earth i met her one she's a lovely woman like she really is lovely so if i get a chance to be on definitely say hello but i it's great to see again that they're taking care of the staff members and it's just little steps like that it just really gets people back into the club it doesn't sound like much just getting people back on a decent wage and helping financially really does make a difference at this football club anyway there's one more stop we're going to take today's video than that better up back all day guys there's so many different changes behind me guys is the stack that is now shut forever on may the first that was the final day of this stack and the reason for that is because i knew hey trot and c boom would get built there now jamie ruben is a big partner because he's behind the development of it he's gonna be putting all the pieces in place to get about they're gonna be nine thousand work i said it'd be one of the biggest headshot nc build in the uk now over the next few years i expect jimmy ruben to continue to make his mark in the castle i think you'll get more development going there's rumors at the minute that the old first issue you plan to build a hotel there i need a research remote missed so i can't confirm anything but quite a few people are talking about that one so again i might make a video separately on that if i find out more information but yeah i expect jimmy room to continue to make his mark in the city he's clearly he has intentions of the city has interests in it he's a businessman of course he will be in it to make a profit but it's good to see that he also has an interest in the city wants to improve as much as possible and with his money in place it also needs less chance to finish closing down for example under a previous owner likes a game for example shops are closing down it means more workers redundant so it's good to see the owners continuously trying to improve the city and over the next two three years i expect a lot more work to be done so keep an eye on that guys anyway guys thank you all for watching the video today something a little bit different we'll talk a bit more about the city itself instead of all of it based on your cast now if you like this sort of thing let me know i do not in the future maybe i do some interviews for example and see how people themselves are actually affected by the take i was plenty of contacting donors so guys if you enjoy this sort of thing make sure to leave some recommendations down below but anyway you know really fascinating the world around the castle and just see the impact that the team was made this is just in the short term as well imagine two three years time there's gonna be so many differences not just on the pitch but off the pitch as well and i mean what a football team to support i thought i'm gonna see him i'm buzzing for the summer i'm buzzing for the future ahead i know this football club will do everything in its power to be the best team in the world and it's going to be one hell of a journey out for sure definitely better the last 14 years anyway guys enjoy yourselves once the season's over we go again and i'm extremely excited but yeah i'll still the next one though cheers for watching,"The transcript discusses the transformation of Newcastle United

m5pVViOwGAc,Who is Mohammed Bin Salman and How is the Newcastle TAKEOVER going to Change the World of Football?,there is a new oil takeover imminent in european football and of course everybody is talking about it the name on everyone's lips is mohammed bin salman the club he's taking the ownership of newcastle united but first of all who is this guy mohammed bin salman is the 36 year old crown prince of saudi arabia he's also a politician and serves as the current and first deputy prime minister of the country he is the minister of defense and at the time he was appointed he was the youngest in the world his father salman bin abdulaziz al-saad the king of saudi arabia is worth 18 billion u.s dollars and is the third richest royal in the world he's wealthier than the queen of england the prince of wales the queen of the netherlands the prince of monaco and the king of spain all put together so when we talk about the crown prince's acquisition of the premier league club having been in the works for the past 18 months just know that money was never the problem we do believe he can acquire three newcastles without breaking a sweat with the takeover said to be worth about 300 million us dollars so why has it taken so long if they had all the money well a couple of reasons actually first the ban on be in sports in saudi arabia had to be lifted to allow premier league games to be broadcast legally in the country also the big piracy issue in the country had to be resolved or at least be in the resolution process those two boxes have now been checked furthermore the crown prince mohammed bin salman had to give assurances to the premier league that if the takeover happens the saudi government would not be involved in the everyday operations of newcastle this was the main issue that really delayed the sale of the club and was rumored to have led to the breakdown of the transaction in july 2020 but that has all been resolved right now and their takeover has been done the saudi consortium will own eighty percent of the club with the remaining twenty percent being distributed among two other partnerships of course newcastle fans are excited about this especially after seeing how an oil takeover has really helped fellow premier league club manchester city in recent years since that takeover city have gone on to establish themselves as one of the biggest clubs in england and even in europe being able to buy the players they want and build a formidable team and with how wealthy the crown prince is this may just be the case for newcastle in the coming years newcastle may just rise again and begin to compete better than they ever have in their history and well many of the fans don't even have much love for the current owner they believe he is responsible for running the club to the ground in his tenure newcastle have been relegated twice so surely they're excited about new owners coming in and the new owners being super wealthy sure is a sweet sweet icing on the cake but of course not everyone is happy about this imminent takeover first of all the traditional football supporters who hate it when billionaires buy clubs and then the clubs go on to build an incredible team by buying the best players in the world but we think that these ones will just have to get used to seeing things like this because it seems like this is the direction the world of football is going right now secondly we think steve bruce won't really love this new takeover because history has shown that most times after a takeover the first thing that happens is for the new owners to replace the manager so now that this takeover is finalized steve bruce who was named premier league manager of the month in april may just be out of a job pretty soon it also doesn't help the gaffer's case that he's still yet to win a game this season with newcastle currently sitting in the relegation zone more so he's considered by a large part of the newcastle fan base as the current owner's puppet thirdly other premier league clubs are surely not very enthusiastic about another club being bought by a super wealthy billionaire especially with what they've seen and are still seeing happen with manchester city another set of people that will not be very elated about mohamed bin salman coming to the premier league are the human rights activists because bin salman might be wealthy famous and heir to the saudi throne but he is surely not a saint amnesty international has since warned that the saudi crown prince is trying to sports wash his reputation according to them anyone found to be critical of the royal family in the country has been threatened arrested or even exiled the u.s intelligence department even fingered the prince as the one who approved the assassination of jamal khashoggi a saudi arabian journalist who was known to be publicly critical about the saudi regime of course the prince has since denied having any involvement with the death of the journalist anyway sad as it may be the deal has happened and prince mohammed bin salman is the new owner of newcastle united the saudi consortium has already said that their priority will be to improve upon the club's infrastructure so maybe we'll be seeing early investments in the club's training facilities academy and other projects but one thing is pretty certain they'll be doing something pretty quick to get the club out of the relegation zone because surely the saudi royalty did not bargain for a championship club they definitely want to be in the english top flight and compete for trophies with the team they will build but one huge question to be asked is why newcastle united with how much the prince is worth he surely could have acquired much bigger clubs like arsenal or even manchester united why did he go for a club who've been in and out of the championship in recent years sincerely it's hard to tell why exactly the prince who heads saudi arabia's public investment fund went for newcastle but we believe it was more an economic decision than anything else perhaps they did the numbers and decided it would be more profitable for them to acquire newcastle than these big clubs we also think that they were presented with a huge opportunity in a club far from where it used to be and fans unhappy with the current ownership anyway it will be really interesting to see what this all takeover will mean for newcastle and even the premier league you know psg since their takeover they've been able to acquire neymar messi and buffet sergio ramos di maria donnaruma and other superstars it'll be interesting to see the caliber of players prince mohammed who is worth more than the psg president will be able to bring over to the club also psg and manchester city which were both taken over by wealthy arabians have since gone on to dominate their respective leagues and even made champions league finals for the first time in their history do you think mohamed bin salman will be able to do this for newcastle united let us know what you think in the comments also let us know what you think about the whole takeover

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the implications of this takeover. The move is significant due to the prince's immense wealth and the ongoing conversation around sportswashing. The acquisition involved resolving legal and broadcast issues with Premier League games in Saudi Arabia. There are mixed reactions to the takeover: Newcastle fans are optimistic, referencing Manchester City’s success following a similar acquisition, whereas critics, including human rights activists and other Premier League clubs, express concern. Amnesty International warns of potential sportswashing, given the Saudi government’s human rights record and Mohammed bin Salman’s alleged involvement in human rights abuses, including the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Despite these concerns, the deal emphasizes plans to invest in the club’s infrastructure and improve its competitive standing. Questions arise about the strategic choice of Newcastle United over more prestigious clubs, suggesting economic motives.

BvE_U8KANnI,The Controversial Rise of Newcastle United,foreign games left in the Premier League season Newcastle sits third place in the Premier League with four points separating them and fifth place Liverpool Newcastle in a space of 15 months have come from relegation certainties to potentially qualifying for the Champions League however there is one big shiny very colorful elephant in a room that typically a story like this should be celebrated should be loaded as an incredible achievement there is a cloud over the head of Newcastle fans any eyes are fans of other clubs that seems to taint the success that they may be having and overall I understand that really no Newcastle fans cares in the slightest I'm here to offer a bit of balancing and to give both sides to the argument here into is newcastle's Rise controversial in any way is it Justified and is it I guess for lack of a better term Fair tell me down below your thoughts are newcastle's rise and how do you sit with it how do you think about how it's gone and do you think that it is I guess in these terms deserved or right just all these kind of things because sadly in football as we've seen many times that it can never just be about the football there's so much more of a bigger thing around it and in this case it is definitely about politics at times more than what is being played in the pitch and that seems to take a lot of the shine away which in many cases is for right reasons and for offer cases and wrong reasons so yeah tell me down below your thoughts make sure to smash the like button let's try to hit 3

also thank you for the support of Masala as well my design company we've hit 1 000 orders already in first month which is insane I've been working with Burnley Rotherham lutantown this incredible I've linked down below use chord 1000 for 15 off the code is available for next two days for hitting a thousand order so go check it out if you're interested and let's get into the video [Music] foreign [Music] so before we begin let's break down one very important word that is very important for this video and that is a word Sports washing Sports washing by definition is a term used to describe the practice of individuals groups corporations or governments using Sports to improve reputations tarnish by wrongdoing now how does this link with Newcastle United Newcastle United is owned 80 by the public investment fund what does this mean well pif is a sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia valued at 315 billion pounds that is so much money that you can't even imagine it and a company is simply an investing firm that invest funds raised from the sale of oil on behalf of the Saudi Arabian government it is also important to highlight that Newcastle is also shared by two other companies by RB Sports and media and PCP Capital Partners RB Sports and media run by David and Simon Rubin the PCP Capital Partners element is where you see the likes of Amanda stable he's going to become the face of Newcastle United's ownership now it is important to say that Amanda stavely actually tried to buy Newcastle United back in 2017 with a region bid of 300 million pounds which failed at the time and with the knowledge of football she partnered with the likes of pif thanks to her connections to Middle Eastern investors due to a company PCP Capital she joined on board of the Takeover too so that is pretty much the Takeover from of course Mike Ashley so how much did it takeover cost it cost 300 million for the buyout so what is a problem well I'm sure that you already know is two things and that is number one being the fact that a club is being run by a estate many clubs in Premier League being ran by a local businessman with a lot of money want to invest into the football club and others being ran by oligarchs and just multi-billionaires seeing football as a new investment vehicle and this is technically no different just in a much much larger scale people are concerned that this may lead to a slippery slope that money would be taken over more and more and that in terms of fairness in terms of actually competing with one another as a football club on the pitch it may may lead to a massive imbalance of equality when it comes to finances however let's be real money hasn't always been fair when it comes to sport nine times out of ten other than a select few that the best teams in all competition are the ones with the most money or one of those with the most money not in all cases but for the large majority it appeared that there was a lot of pullback when it comes to the top six clubs and of course for obvious reasons they probably saw Newcastle as a threat of entering and penetrating that top six bubble which of course as we've now seen has happened however it's not as binary as that and then there's a second part and that is the critique of Saudi arabian's Saudi regime and their human rights record as pif States on its own website that it acts as the Kingdom's main investment arm to deliver and Achieve attractive Financial returns and long-term value for Saudi Arabia and just by giving an example of the human rights violations I'll show name some here in 2022 15 individuals both Saudi citizens of foreign Nationals to between 50 to 45 years in prison for unfair trials for peaceful expression or Association this includes online speech on Twitter for example woman's rights activists and so on so forth on the 9th of August to specialized Criminal Court to Saudi Arabia they sentenced Salma Al Ser Hub a PhD student and an activist to 34 years in prison to be followed by a 34-year travel ban for her writing and peaceful Twitter activity in support of women's rights in Saudi Arabia this means that dozens of activists continue to serve prison terms for the human rights work for a sample in March 2022 Rife rather buy a blogger and activist was conditionally released after serving a 10-year prison sentence for creating a online forum for public debate in which he was accused of insulting Islam another big topic when it comes to Saudi Arabia is the penalty which is still allowed in Saudi Arabia where people are sentenced for a variety of different crimes and a sample of this was on the 12th of March 2022 81 men citizens of foreign Nationals were also executed they were convicted on a range of offenses including tourism related crimes murder armed robbery and arm smuggling and as many others as well including forced evictions migrants rights and women's and girls rights and also lgbtq rights too before we go any further this is important to highlight why so many people fail to really see Newcastle as Newcastle and not part of the Saudi state where they have these connections and even though many will say stick to football and the fact that as a football team the successes on the pitch is not directly linked to what has happened of in Saudi Arabia for many people they fail to not see the link and that is a problem that we Face here as a term Sports watching has become a lot more popular as a term in recent years of course as far back as Manchester City and you may even say back in all three when it comes to Chelsea and Roman Abramovich and of course recently with the Qatari World Cup as well and people believe that Newcastle and a takeover of the Saudi Investment fund is purely for sports Washington to improve the reputation of the region tell me down below your thoughts on this are you able to separate the link between between the Saudi Investment fund and Newcastle as a football club and as a city the people do you think that they should have any sort of responsibility to keep this in mind or do you think that they shouldn't care because it doesn't really involve them and they have no saying it tell me your thoughts down below so after that let's get into the actual football here and go into what has actually happened on the pitch ever since the takeoff has happened this is what I tweeted two weeks ago saying Newcastle in a UCL is class what they achieved is not due to pumping tons of money on idiotic signings more to their best players were already there and improved massively coached incredibly well recruited perfectly to suit their team fair play proper footballing City now of course this was received fairly reasonably I think most people understand my point here because again as I said earlier many people just cannot look at Newcastle in the same way because when you think a Newcastle they think of Saudi Arabian and their human rights violations and that is a link that people just simply cannot detach with the sports washing element but I will attempt to do my side here and to explain my reasoning for this of course as many people know maybe not people that may know me recently in the last couple weeks and months but I lived in Newcastle for two years when I went to University about five she's got Christ after year old saw me live in Newcastle I met the people I know the people I've been to St James just like two three times as well with friends and this is when they were in a championship and also their first year back in the Premier League and I love the city I love the people of Newcastle and when it comes to a football City the people that I met and for my time there they deserve whatever successor they get I am able to make the Detachment from the Saudi Arabian connections to how it impacts the city and the people surrounding it I'm able to do that other people can't announce completely okay if you try to look at it from purely football just purely football not think about who owns it but simply what they've done in the market and what they've done with the team and how they play it is astonishing what they've achieved this year people this year were expecting Newcastle to maybe you know make a step up and potentially qualify for just Europe in general maybe qualify in the seventh place for the conference League spots maybe even your league Sportsman no one thought they'd be here if anyone thought that Newcastle be top four this year then you'd be a liar because no one thoughts that no one actually reasonably thought that with their team that they have so this is one argument that I've heard and that is ah they spent money so it's not surprising that they're top four they spent money Christ look at all the other teams that spent up money around them and look at where they are the best example is West Ham United the team that was already in a healthy spot they improved on the team spending more money than Newcastle and look at where they're at now West Hammer 15th and were in a relegation dogfight and they may have survived now but they had serious threats of going down and they improved their team by spending more money than what Newcastle spent on an already good team Newcastle spent 185 million euro while West Ham spent 194 million euro and Newcastle spent players on Alexander izak and Anthony Gordon in January who's barely even played really so then there's them you're cheaper like reasonable standings of you know my target for I think 14 15 mil and Nick port for about 9 10 mil and if an academy before and they bought Bruno gamores for about 38 137 mil Chris Wood about 25 which again is ridiculous money but fair enough Joel willick before to take over for 29 mil and then Dan burn and Kieran trippier Matt Target on launch you look at their signings and other than Bruno gameres um izak and maybe botman but I don't even think he's really too far of a of a shout really only Bruno and Isaac are two players he would say would never be at Newcastle if it wasn't for the money and even we can't really say that for sure as Bruno cost about 30 odd you know 38 can of Mill and there's no reason to believe that they could not have just got him anyway but let's say that they couldn't so there's really just two players there that they wouldn't have got competitor to West Ham you spent you know more money in the Newcastle on an already good team that was qualifying for European football on Lucas pakatar skill Maka argued Maxwell Corner Emerson carrer Danny yings Flynn Downs Ariola these are the players that a lot of them has not performed that well this year almost took their time skip macca they send a strike and he's barely really playing David Morris isn't really liking him MasterCard has been injured the entire year unfortunately for him so for anyone saying that I already spent money they should be in top four well you should be saying the same thing about West Hamden right because they were in a better position they spent more money than them and they've got worse and also missing a large elephant in a room here you spent money therefore you should do well or talk to my boys Chelsea and tell me how their money has served them well in the last few months how much is it half a billion in one window in January yeah just because you spent money doesn't mean you're guaranteed any success you guarantee nothing unless that money is used wisely and or for there it is not been used wisely whatsoever you need good recruitment a good coach to actually blend it all together and a good system and philosophy too a good team ethic you know money can buy you players but it can't buy you a team and that is how football works and we can also look at the players that are doing well at Newcastle and well let's look at the top goal scorers oh look it is two players at the top of the charts they were already there before we even started a year Callum Wilson 17 goals and Mickey amiron with 11 goals so they were already there is X score 10 but then look down below jordanton Jacob Murphy two players that were already there armor on and Jordan and Jacob Murphy were all seen as like meme players at Newcastle they were both like laughing stocks Jordan was like one of the biggest memes it was like a year or two ago people laughed at him on Twitter almost every single day Newcastle fans hated them almost but under Eddie Howe in this new system they've turned the likes of Jordan turn into what was a forward into one of the best boxer box midfielders in World football right now or at least one of the most informed and then Jacob Murphy who people never took seriously and now he's playing out of his skin and same thing with Mickey Amur on 2 who had an insane run in the early part of the year so not only is Teddy Hal talked you know players who are there to blend into a system which has worked out well he's not spent a lot of money in ton of players he's only spent two three big players each window to then go into his team he's Blended out with his team that he already had I mean I mean Christ no one looked a damn burn and thought yes that's the missing piece to get them European football and let's not forget as well that the players that he had and the club that he took over was a a club with a losing culture a loser culture don't forget in the first 19 games of last season they had 11 points they were almost a a sure thing to go down if they didn't get took over and it didn't get any help would Eddie Howe have kept them up without the Takeover I firmly believe that he would have because it's not like they stand up by the Skin of Their Teeth they stayed up by quite a large margin how many points you say oh just 14 points and pretty much almost on the top half of the table finishing 11th place and I want to just get one thing straight here that I'm gonna get accusations of people saying that I'm twerking for Newcastle fans or whatever but look I think that they're doing a fantastic job and when I see people completely um just dumb it down and just make it irrelevant due to who has took over the club and just saying because they spent money their footage should be doing well while they're not in seventh or eighth or sixth they're third they're in the Champions League almost or you know that almost they're almost qualified they've got three more games they're four points ahead they just need to make sure that they get two more wins and then it's done is that possible I still think it's possible it should be possible but hey it's football I guess you never know sometimes but they had a losing culture at that football club so to turn it around especially with the players that they had and has turned into World beaters like again Murphy Jordan so and so forth I think it's exceptional so what is Eddie House tactics how does he blend us all together well he plays a four three three and it's designed to sit predominantly in the central third and to be extremely narrow and being devastating in fast breaks on a transition to make the most out of their counter attacking players Newcastle is more about being more defensively sound and to make sure that if you don't concede you can't lose games that is why they have got the best defensive record all year which is incredible Newcastle with three games have to go has only considered 31 goals Newcastle having the best defensive record in the division with a team of the following Co-op Kieran trippier Fabian Shaw seven botman Dan burn I mean it's a decent back line Nick Pub fantastic goalkeeper and has been a massive part of their success because he offers so much Karen trippier not only has he got fantastic attack in prowess with his deliveries but in the backline he's a leader that they need to get them over the line and the rest of the back four are tall are physical and we'll make sure they make it as tough as possible with Shah Batman and Dan burn and scoring goals they've not been bad either they are joined fifth for the most score scored all year scoring more goals of Manchester United but being less than Tottenham or Liverpool I thought sample people say that bresno a fantastic team and that they have scored so many goals so many great attacking players but they've scored the same amount of goals as Newcastle so to say that Newcastle just a defensive team is probably unfair to them so that is in quite a condensed version I think what has happened at Newcastle United and how well they've been doing now there is a bit of a slight chance that they may not qualify for Champions League which I hope they do because I think it's great to see new teams in the Champions League but there's a slight chance because they've lost against Arsen recently and also they just drew yesterday against Leeds away they've got three big games coming up and they got Brett in a home which is gonna be a great game to see and they've got Leicester home where it should be a big chance to win however let's do a fight if it alive still and in last day Chelsea away who Chelsea have I mean I don't even know how to explain Chelsea I don't know how they've been so poor but they've been so so poor it's created a thing that Chelsea could be maybe the easiest one out of the three so with that said in my opinion the success at Newcastle are having is not just solely down to the money that they spent because when you look at how much they spent this year or even last year it's nothing different to what other teams are spending too for teams that spend over 100 million got quite a lot of the league you got of course Man City United because Leeds United you've got the likes of war with 100 50 million spends in this one year Southampton spent over 100 million as well in terms of NetSpend there's only 40 million difference between Southampton and Newcastle and luck where Southampton is now Spurs Arsenal West Ham Forest The Forest of course they spent 156 million netspenders as well which is just five mil less than Newcastle but of course Forest had a much weaker um starting block so it's unfair to the competitive because their team was already very poor and it had to spend to improve their team so that's not really a fair comparison however newcasts haven't spent anything that's really wild and out of the ordinary and the players that he has spent an honor for me not really unreasonable players over them maybe two so to say that it is just money and that's why they're doing well I think is really unfair and just not really giving credit to the great job that Eddie have has done and then back to where we started which is of course how can you be happy for them because of the Saudi Arabian links and for me as a person I lived in Newcastle I I I think that I got a good idea about the people up there and they are good people and it's a proper football and City and before I get people saying that you know I'm all over and whatever else I say the same thing about Sunderland 2 okay before I get something found something to go with me too Sunderland Nottingham Forest the Sheffield United the Sheffield Wednesday clubs proper football than cities and leads to their good cities with people who have their Club in the Forefront of their minds at all times that's kind of what football has been always about for me the people the experiences that a club can create for the community and also I missed out about like Aston Villa Everton too footballing proper football and cities proper football and clubs so with that said tell me your thoughts down below I'll see you guys next time for another video I've got a couple of ideas in mind for some other football clubs of course you could always suggest videos for me to do there's been quite a few for the likes of like Luton and Portsmouth as well some like footballing stories I can go into maybe some more positive ones too as well maybe even footballers I got an idea about doing one about Zlatan Ibrahimovic like a footballing store but I hear my kind of like documentary type so I got that in the works as well so feel free and recommend videos that you think should be doing as well in the world of football or YouTube as well and yeah and smash a like let's try to hit 3 000 likes and subscribe if you are new and I'll see you next time

It discusses sportswashing, where the club's success is shadowed by Saudi Arabia's human rights issues. Despite their achievements, the ownership's connection to the Saudi state and its questionable human rights record creates controversy. The narrator examines whether Newcastle's rise is purely financial, pointing out that while funds have aided their success, excellent management and coaching have also played crucial roles. The transcript also contrasts Newcastle's spending with other clubs, emphasizing that money alone doesn't guarantee success, as highlighted by other Premier League teams' failures despite significant spending. It argues that Newcastle's rise is due to strategic recruitment and excellent coaching rather than just investment. The discussion touches upon the issue of dissociating the football club's achievement from its owners’ political and ethical controversies. The sentiment is a mix of admiration for Newcastle’s performance and the broader implications of sports investment as a means of image rehabilitation for regions with poor human rights records.",Sportswashing,-1,No,Newcastle United ownership,Saudi Arabia
56wWl3Uezjg,REACTING TO THE NEWCASTLE UNITED TAKEOVER w/ WillNE | #WNTT,all right ladies and gentlemen welcome back to a fairly hungover edition of football daily where today we need to talk about newcastle united [Music] yes lads it has finally happened newcastle fans worldwide rejoice mike ashley is out of the exit door and i think you're pretty happy about it i mean i still remember when mike ashley first took over and he said didn't he i really want to have some fun i want to win some trophies i still remember the images of him being sat in the stand in that newcastle shirt i mean just look at the state of him look at the state of him [Applause] and it has been a long old 14 years hasn't it and his description of i want to have some fun it's probably the direct opposite of what's actually happened at newcastle what is the opposite of the word fun show is probably more appropriate i mean let's not forget this the man who's been in charge of two of the six relegations in newcastle's 129 year history rebranded st james's park the sports direct arena his treatment of kevin keegan was pretty shambolic his treatment of jonas gutierrez was even worse i mean there's pretty much an endless list of faults caused by mike ashley in fact i saw a clip earlier of gary neville explaining this in a way that's much more eloquent than my hungover head can comprehend my castle shouldn't communicate to these fans he doesn't talk to them he can't resonate with them they don't feel what he feels he doesn't feel what they feel that is that is where it's disjointed disconnected but does that matter yeah absolutely matters because what we're saying here is that yes of course it's run as a business it has to be sensible but this is not a business football clubs can not just be a business they're more than that they you know football club 40 years ago we've seen the most important component in the community the premier league has come there have been international investors come in and there have been good international investors that have been good domestic investors and would be good bad of both but you have to connect with the fans and the people in the city my cashier does not connect with the people in this city let's forget about mike cashley though he's out in the past isn't he let's focus on the new ownership the saudi arabian public investment fund also known as p i f now the p i f are worth a reported 305 billion pounds 305 billions put that into some context yeah manchester city's ownership group worth somewhere in the region of 20 billion 25 billion roman abramovich somewhere in the region of 8 to 10 billion the saudi arabian public investment fund 305 billion 305.  me but we do have to cover both sides of this story yes they might be worth an awful lot of money but saudi arabia also has one of the worst human rights records on planet earth and yes the premier league has claimed that it's received assurances that the saudi state will not be involved directly in the running of newcastle at any level i've read the statement but you can still see the links let's not forget the chairman of the pif is mohammed bin salman who's the de facto leader of saudi arabia the crown prince of saudi arabia and there are plenty of reasons that amnesty international loads of other humanitarian groups have lobbied the premier league to stop this happening they are totally opposed to it because like many ownership groups around the world you know we've also seen it potentially at psg potentially at manchester city this is about more than just the sporting project this is about improving saudi arabia in the eyes of the world in fact i'm not the best at explaining this sort of thing i'm a bit of a dunce so i'm throwing over to a professor professor simon chadwick who talked about it much much better than i can on sky sports i think they want to do it for lots of reasons um they they like football in saudi arabia they want to be at football's top table but i think this is not specifically about football i i think they're doing it for industrial and economic reasons to diversify their economy they're about to for example launch a new airline you can imagine that new airline appearing as newcastle united new shirt sponsor the saudis are also very keen to project a very different image of themselves to the image that many of us are used to and so those concerns by amnesty international which some people refer to as sport washing are also part of the equation too so this is this is not simply 11 vs 11 and the squad up at st james's park it's a much more complicated issue than that but i'm interested to hear from you guys at home what do you think of the pif takeover of newcastle united let me know in the comments below what are your thoughts what are your opinions i'm very interested on this one because i think a lot of people are very very torn over it anyway the woman who made all this happen amanda stavely i've heard her name more than any name involved in newcastle takeover over the last four or so years however long it's been now she was speaking yesterday wasn't she about just what the future holds for newcastle united and before we get into sort of predictions and reactions let's have a little watch league football is the best in the world uh and newcastle united is the best team in the world and we want to see it get those trophies obviously at top of the premier league in europe but to get trophies it means investment patience time and we want everybody just to um you work with us to build the club to what it needs to be where do you see newcastle united as a club in say five to ten years time well we want newcastle newcastle united is deserves to be top of the premier league and you know we want to get there and it'll take time but we will get there yeah i'll have you the chance to speak to the manager as well i did speak to the manager and say hello and introduce ourselves and we look forward to speaking to him over the next few few days what is the future for steve bruce here at the football club we we you know obviously we're very supportive as steve uh and we've spoken to him and we know what we're going to do is is not talk about managers or what big signings we can make at the moment we're going to do a review right through the football operations uh we're going to do a review of all the commercial side of the club as well and we're going to come back and make some decisions now she didn't say it directly there but i think it's kind of growing in likelihood right that steve bruce is going to leave his role as newcastle united manager and there's going to be some sweeping changes at the club so i thought we'd finish with you know some fun little predictions around newcastle you know nothing too serious and i wanted to get in touch with number one somebody who's not too serious number two somebody's a massive newcastle united fan who popped into med straight away will any so i said will come on mate give us your reaction to that newcastle takeover and also throw us a prediction for your first major signing in a newcastle united he did 50 of it hello football daily how is it going i hope he's all well i am uh just here to say i don't give a who was saying i really could not care less right as long as it's no more ice baths in wheelie bins it's a positive right we'll just keep allen build around allen all is well also just want to say special shout out to uh zach shella and kieran carlin for sending me this when it fell through last year lovely slides all the best have a good one so will like most newcastle fans don't really give a who the first major signing is but i thought we'd play along now on sunday rides we're doing a newcastle special so i want you guys at home to put in the comments right now who is going to be the manager that takes over who is going to be their first major signing and who is going to be their first major sale i think that's an important one too so i'm going to give my free for those categories who i would pick as each one i think the manager i reckon they might go with frank lampard i think there's probably better options you know if i was newcastle united new owners i'd be doing all i can to lure potter away from brighton seriously i'd be chucking everything at him but i think they might go for frank lampard a bit of a statement a bit of a name he's gonna cause a few ripples across the footballing world frank lampard back in a job superstar ex-footballer takes over at newcastle so i could see them going down the front lampard route in terms of star signing i can see them signing coutinho i think that's sort of a name that gets the headlines he's gonna be on big wages a little bit robinho-esque barcelona gonna be very very keen to do a deal i think they might end up dipping quite heavily into those sort of barcelona real madrid juventus reject pools um so i'm gonna go lampard coutinho first major sale i mean do they have any major sellable assets not really so i don't know what to say here they're gonna get rid of john joe shelby rejoice so that was a sort of reaction a bit of prediction to newcastle united i don't want to go too in depth because like i said we are doing a special sunday vives on how to rebuild newcastle how to bring it back from the dirt let us know your thoughts in the comments below like i said let me know your manager your major signing your major sale hit the like button hit subscribe thanks very much for watching up the tune,"The transcript discusses the recent takeover of Newcastle United by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF), which marks the end of Mike Ashley's controversial 14-year ownership. The host reflects on Ashley's tenure, noting his mismanagement and disconnection with Newcastle fans. The new ownership, the Saudi PIF, is highlighted as having significant financial strength with an estimated worth of £305 billion, dwarfing other notable football club owners. However, the discussion pivots to the controversy surrounding the Saudi takeover, noting Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record and the claims of sportswashing. Amnesty International and other human rights organizations have opposed the takeover, emphasizing that the move is more than just a football investment; it's also a strategic effort by Saudi Arabia to improve its global image and diversify its economy. Professor Simon Chadwick offers insights, suggesting the motivations include industrial and economic diversification and an attempt to reshape Saudi Arabia's international image. The host invites viewers to share their opinions, acknowledging the divisive sentiment among football fans regarding the takeover. Finally, speculation about the club's future under new management is discussed, including potential managerial and player changes.",Sportswashing,-1,No,Newcastle United ownership,Saudi Arabia
LiaxgseTd7M,What is going on at Newcastle? Understanding Newcastle United's proposed takeover | Premier League,"it's 300 odd million but it doesn't seem to be straightforward can you feel the same based on what you've read yeah well it's it's it's a very very odd situation I think there was a lot of interest at the start Gabby in Newcastle and that was for obvious reasons obviously Rafa Benitez was still there at the time it seemed like a just a good investment that they were heading towards you know probably in the region of between 20 and 30 million in in profit Newcastle was a very very appealing proposition and was a lot of interest as you said three years ago it was it was probably a little bit over that at this stage but my gosh he was looking to do a very quick deal and there was there was five groups that signed NDA's and putting in letters of intent to move forward but a lot of them he wanted to actually complete this deal very quickly in the same way that he bought the club and just he's got a different take on how things work from a business perspective to your regular investor if you were spending that amount of money you want to do proper due diligence and everything else around it so obviously Amanda Staveley had what was one of those individuals who signed an NDA and an LOI I'm sorry come on come on come up with the acronyms NDA I think people understand is a non-disclosure agreement LOI I can assure you jaws has no idea what you're talking about so that's a letter of intent thank you meaning that you will agree to consider the investment and you're within a certain range depending on how to do diligence pans out so that's that's how that works so there was media reports that were on confirmed that that her group at the time I had baited for the club but it was a low a low bid and there was an interview in The Times afterwards etc and a lot of it was blamed on Mike Ashley and you know that my gosh she was a difficult person to deal with and I think most people accepted that Mike Ashley is a soft made man he's from London which is relevant here because you know the Northeast is kind of its own saying he made a lot of money in Sporting Goods with his chain of stores Sports Direct he bought New Castle's 13 years ago I think for around a hundred and thirty million pounds something like that and you kind of get the sense correct me if I'm wrong for the last four or five years the Newcastle fans haven't exactly been enamored with him um he's he's not really in one of those owners who puts a lot of his own money in or doesn't come up isn't seen that way Newcastle fans have this idea that they should be you know competing or they have the heft because obviously they get big big attendances that they have to go and compete for the you know close to the top of the table many of them do and the fact that he's an outsider the fact that he's not very pleasant the fact that he never speaks in public all this stuff didn't quite mix would you say that's fair I think overall yeah like that that's a good description of Mike Ashley in in a nutshell so I think you're a point about him not been let's just say liked by the fans etc is a really really big one here you've got a massive you know passionate one City fan base so that that's the real potential here along with a modern city centre Stadium so like it is a very very good proposition and you look at the situation I think there's been a lot of fair boycotts by fans of you know buying any concessions at games etc so that's obviously an initial revenue that will come back to a new owner straight away and I think any owner who comes in you know will be extremely well appreciated initially because the fans just won actually out which has been made clear so they did it the other massive opportunity here is in sponsorship uplifts obviously he's used a lot of this to advertise Sports Direct you know there was the controversial renaming of the stadium it that all of the advertising everywhere is is relating to his operations and even shirt deal that they signed with with for no date last year is worth between five and six million depending on how the club performs that's probably half of where a shirt deal for the club the size of Newcastle should be so there's a lot of uplift straightaway that's available in this but back to your original question I've spoken to two sources and in Saudi Arabia and it this interest is real and I know it's been reported that way across the media but I've heard it from the horse's mouth the only potential issues that you have here Gabi are that you know you've obviously got to go through the Premier League ownership tests and who is going to go through that from a from a Saudi perspective obviously yeah the other thing that I've heard is that they would potentially look at other clubs if the right opportunity was available so there could be a situation where a little bit like what happened with Roman Abramovich who obviously looked at a number of clubs and ended up on Chelsea you could have a situation where they see something that they liked better and now is a really really strange time yeah okay you want to ask you about that cuz how do you I I always thought Newcastle's actually I mean giving you your old business when you were buying and selling clubs success on behalf of other people yeah how do you begin to put a value on Newcastle because hey you've got the current pandemic and all the uncertainty that's that's engendered you know with that and be it's a bit of an unusual club because as you said like they have massive attendances I think I mean it's close to 50,000 I mean they oh yeah yeah over 55 I mean they didn't nearly sellout every week um which is really good but then I'm not sure and there might I'm sure there's people you know there's metrics for this I don't know how national or international their fan base is in the sense that they're hugely popular but they seem to me to be much more of a regional club then you know I'm not just a Liverpool United but even like maybe a club like like Everton secondly Newcastle is not one of the you know that area of the country is not one of the wealthier areas of the country and of course that that matters as well so how do you begin to decide well why is it 300 million oh and you always have the risk of relegation right so how do you begin to decide how do you mean to put a number on it yeah well actually I did a PhD on this subject exactly so I came up with a model and to be honest with you the 300 million isn't a million miles off the initial valuation that Mike Ashley had was quite north of that which was unrealistic and I wouldn't say it was ridiculously unrealistic I think he was looking for about 450 million but that was just after the wave of Chinese investors that had come into the market and it was a little bit of an arms race just to buy assets that were available so I think he was a little bit late to the table in terms of us but overall I think that the evaluation in normal times is fair but and obviously we're not in normal times now so a lot of clubs could potentially hit the wall here so that you know if you're an opportunist investor and you could actually go in and buy a club that that has gone well potentially going into administration so there are other opera obviously not in the Premier League but there will be opportunities outside of the Premier League and you're just a perfect fall but another hundred users on this point cuz there's always some confusion about this about billionaires and rich people it's one thing to have to be very rich and have lots of wealth and assets it's another thing to have lots of liquidity very rich people but the Saudis might be slightly different but most rich people even if they have 300 million they don't just keep it in their bank account and then go off and buy something they generally have a tied-up elsewhere most assets have depreciated in in value given unless you're making masks or something or we're running Tesco I guess so people don't want to go and sell their assets now because they're worth less than what they were before the pandemic so basically they have to borrow money now the question is you know even very rich people to borrow money but the problem with borrowing money is there's just a lot less cash and a lot less money out there that's available and those people are willing to lend money there's people lining up at the door saying hey can I have some money can have some money so they can there's probably bit of a credit crunch there as well meaning that you have to pay more to borrow the money again is that accurate and could that be part of the reason why maybe the Saudis might be best placed because they may be really are sitting on a big pile of cash and I think there's elements of that you know there's a lot of people that have dipped into the regular markets here on that basis that have money and feel that there's value my gosh tea has made no secret out of the fact that most of his wealth is tied up in in in chairs basically so but the danger with the Saudis as well is that they hold so many assets and they've they own so many different things globally that this could almost get lost in the portfolio I know it's it's quite a sexy one and you know it gives them global notoriety but at the end of the day yeah it could be a plaything for a little while and then you know if they're not doing too well they they lose interest Tom you said that the Saudis we're also looking at other clubs and other options from from the club that we know are available for sale whether you know Chelsea is not officially but maybe a United a bit the same if you were sorry if you had all that money where well what cut for you would be the most appealing effectively you look at the the level of wealth and let's just say the resources that are there you would expect that if the Saudis were coming into the market that they'd try and buy the biggest asset that's available and I don't think this is necessarily available but most football clubs at the right offer the owners will sell and for that reason I think I snore would be the the one that that would probably be the most interesting to that if they were moving into it into I know Arsenal that's moving slightly down terms of their their let's just say Premier League status but there's still a big london-based club and you mentioned the geographical elements earlier on Gabby I think that factor comes in to all of this because let's face it if if you're you know involved in this from a Saudi perspective you're probably going to be based on yourself in London and and just going up to Newcastle okay thanks so much for watching ESPN

of Newcastle United Football Club, emphasizing the numerous complications in the acquisition process. The conversation highlights Newcastle's desire for new ownership, due to dissatisfaction with current owner Mike Ashley, who purchased the club many years ago. Fans are discontent with Ashley because he is not heavily invested in the club and is perceived as an outsider. There is significant opportunity for new owners to benefit from sponsorship and fan engagement, biding time until Ashley exits. Saudi Arabian interest in Newcastle is genuine, but potential ownership must navigate Premier League ownership tests. The dialogue concludes by analyzing Newcastle's valuation in relation to other football clubs, current pandemic conditions, and increasing credit restrictions. Wealthy investors are considering alternatives for this opportunity, including clubs with larger financial reach or geographic benefits, such as Arsenal.

7BWaCDRzN_Y,"""It's heartbreaking!"" | Devastated Newcastle United fan reacts to the Saudi takeover collapse",yeah tom thanks very much you've just said that this story is dominated this afternoon let me tell you it's dominated the northeast and particularly newcastle for the last 17 weeks it's the last thing the newcastle united supporters wanted to hear this afternoon that the takeover essentially has fallen through the saudi-backed consortium led by amanda stavley who had agreed that 300 million pound price tag with mike ashley a way back at the beginning of april have essentially pulled the plug for those reasons um that you said when of course we had a statement from them earlier i've also told you that newcastle united as a club were amazed they were surprised they had no idea the statement from the potential buyers was set to come today but it's left to support us here at newcastle in a state of shock and i'm joined by one of them it's matthew renton from the magpie channel and matthew i know you guys have lived and breathed this as i have said there for the last 17 weeks um just tell me try and sum up how you're feeling this afternoon i think it's uh heartbreaking for every new fascinating fan to be honest because the club's been in limbo for what 14 16 weeks now now the club's dead to be honest no newcastle fan wants to face another season here under the tenure mike ashley another the usual no hope no ambition relegation battle every year and i think it's been absolute force from the premier league a disgrace and it shambles by keith masters in the premier league it seems as they've got what they've wanted the saudis have pulled out without them having to make a decision which they've took way too long to do why is it took this long we need answers on that and for us to now be facing like i say no passion season actually nothing to aim for it's it's heartbreaking utterly heartbreaking i mean they may as well keep the games behind closed doors next year because i don't think any newcast fans are going to want to come here yeah i can hear the pain in your voice did you feel though as the weeks went on and on that this was set to come were you not half expecting this news i don't think so i think i was always caught up in the fact that they had to make it look like they're obviously doing the right due diligence the right checks and whatnot that it was going to come through because of obviously all the positive signs were heard early on and throughout there there's no red flags there's no flags it just seemed like they were waiting for the premier league finished season to finish for the transfer window to start and then surely would get some answers because we still obviously haven't heard what what the hall it was the privacy this and that but at the end of the day we thought if it wasn't going to happen why is it took this time to get there and obviously the saudis patience is war thumb which is a a huge heartbreaking loss to every newcastle fan because like i say we're stuck now if none of that doesn't doesn't care at all about this club i need to ask you this and it's a very sensitive topic but a lot has been said one about the piracy as you mentioned but also the human rights record the poor human rights record over in saudi arabia can you understand why the premier league assumably as a result of those two things were really taking their time to come to decision and i suppose haven't yet not this long not kind of take that long to understand that and if the premier league along the likes of other organizations like boxing for example anthony joshua has just had a fight in saudi arabia i kind of see the problem with it with them taking over this obviously whatever's going on in that country is of huge issues but that's not our issues where regular football fans do yeah come weekend we go want to see how our club do well that's another part of the world i mean if you look at everybody now i'm sure you'll find some dirty things about them has it in some ways has this kind of got you through this pandemic these last few months i know it's been difficult and a lot of you guys are struggling mentally because you've been so desperate for it to happen but with the hope that there might have been some sort of gold at the end of the rainbow it might have happened has it got got you through this and and how does it feel now knowing definitely that's it as a youtuber in the early stages it's helped us massively to have something to do and talk about even at home interacting with fans on the likes of stream yard and zoom but now this whole saw guys just completely sucked the life and passion out of me for football i've just got no desire now to even watch football next season the thought of coming here next season it's it's heartbreaking for me i mean like like i see there's just there's just nothing to aim for nothing to hope for you look at this club on this day in 1996 saying alan shira we've done nothing of node since and we'll do nothing in the mic actually do you take any solace at all from the fact that you now know and you've got the transfer window it's just opened up on monday steve bruce is there it looks as though the club will buy some players to what extent and value we do don't know but you take any solace from the fact that at least you know now and it's not dragging on until the end of the window and you might not do too much business not considering the scouts last year to say that julian was worth 40 million pounds to be honest i think st maxwell will go he's been the miracle if we keep him he'll be another miracle i kind of see him staying at this club in the fight in 17th every year um it's good that it's at least early and there's still but you've got to look there's only six weeks until this the season starts again with the whole coup over 19 there's has about 30 million pounds to spend that gets you absolutely nothing these days no one's going to want to steal it i see i think the likes of saint maximum and de bruff gold probably go and notice respect to steve bruce and the boys they're doing some valiant efforts this season he's done the best he can probably do with what he's got to work with but like i see a newcastle why not want to come back here and watch nil nils and snatch and grab last minute stop his time wins next season there's nothing to pay for um matthew thanks very much for your for your time this afternoon um i know it's a difficult situation for you and i think matthew speaks for a lot of the newcastle united supporters who let me tell you for the last few months everywhere you go they all want to know what's happening with the takeover is it going to happen is it not i think they all hoped that eventually the longer it went on it would eventually be passed through um would it ever have happened i suppose we will never know but the saudi-backed consortium led by amanda stavely has this afternoon and a story broken by sky sports news uh pulled the plug on that deal and i think matthew just kind of sums up exactly how the newcastle united supporters are feeling about that right now yeah okay keith thank you,"The transcript discusses the failed takeover of Newcastle United Football Club by a Saudi-backed consortium, much to the disappointment of the club's supporters. The consortium, led by Amanda Stavley, had agreed upon a price with the current owner, Mike Ashley, but decided to withdraw due to delays and lack of decision from the Premier League. Newcastle fans are heartbroken, feeling their club remains stagnant and without ambition under Ashley. The delays and eventual withdrawal are partly attributed to concerns over piracy issues and Saudi Arabia's human rights record, although some fans dismiss these concerns as irrelevant to their football interests. The fan, Matthew Renton, expresses frustration over the club's current direction and lack of prospect for improvement without the takeover. The uncertainty has been emotionally draining for fans, compounded by the pandemic, leaving them disheartened about future seasons. Despite attempts to find solace in the opening of the transfer window, there's skepticism over potential signings' effectiveness given financial constraints. Ultimately, there’s a sense of despair and disinterest in the upcoming season among fans, reflecting a broader criticism of how the situation has been handled.",Sportswashing,-1,No,Newcastle United ownership,Saudi Arabia
7oVTGh-yr-Y,"Saudi-led takeover of Newcastle United is 'sportswashing', not football",dr david wearing joins me now and there are a lot of people in newcastle who will be very happy to see the back of mike ashley um they will say that they are just going to hold their nose uh and cope with the the new owners what is your view on that well that's their choice i guess but let's be quite clear about why this is happening um the saudi regime is not buying newcastle united because they're great lovers of football and it's certainly not because they've got a great concern for the people of newcastle and their enjoyment of newcastle united's fortunes they're doing it for two main reasons the first is what's called sports watching washing which is using which is authoritarian regimes using sports to whitewash their public image around the world we've seen that in lots of instances we've seen it with the chinese in the 2008 olympics we've seen the russians and the uh world cup a few years ago we see it with the regime in qatar which owns paris saint-germain we see it with the uae and abu dhabi's ownership of manchester city and now we're seeing saudi arabia newcastle united the purchase of a football club to whitewash the image of an authoritarian regime and in the second the second reason why they've bought the club because there's going to be investment in the club but also the investment in the wider community as well one of the ways in which these authoritarian regimes particularly in the gulf and in the middle east bind themselves to the big powers of the global north especially the us france and britain is by investing in these economies and by doing that they're able to prove their worth and their value to the british state and in return for that they'll expect support from the british state in local and geopolitical issues like for example the war in yemen where the saudis have been which assad has been waging for five six years now with a lot of british assistance there's a geopolitical aspect and there's a pr aspect as well um saudi's crime prince mohammed mohamed bin salman has made much of his uh efforts to reform the kingdom it is improving isn't it but how much yeah i mean let's be honest it's not really um and this is something that my research has focused on a lot in the last couple of years the the language of reform is really part of the pr spirit we have to be quite clear about this so i'll give you one example at the same time as the saudis were telling us that they're reforming and using the example of the fact that they are now allowing women to drive cars they locked up the women's rights activists who had campaigned for the right to drive and those women were subject to according to the leading human rights organisations absolutely horrific treatment while jailed for while jailed for campaigning for their basic rights and decided that saudi arabia is reforming in the sense of its politics and sense of political freedoms and civil wars is is just not true i'm afraid what they are doing is reforming their economy and then reforming their economy to give a more sustainable basis for the saudi world family to remain in power and by the way while we're talking about the human rights record of the saudi regime it's not just a question of how the saudi regime treats its own subjects in terms of the jailing and alleged torture of women's rights activists and many other dissidents peaceful distance it's also about the saudis behaviour in yemen where again they're credibly accused by all the world's leading human rights organizations of indiscriminate killing of civilians even if the potential use of starvation as a war tactic which is a war crime and so this is a kind of regime that's now about to it seems purchased newcastle united a regime of a horrific human rights record and a record um of behaviour in war in yemen which mainly which may go all the way up to guilt of potential war crimes and it's this kind of behaviour that they're trying to whitewash with their purchase of newcastle united that's the purpose of the purchase i mean it has been widely reported as you're saying all of these things and amis international um themselves have have lobbied the premier league to try to stop uh this sale going through do you do you think that the premier league will listen to this or do you think they will just allow it anyway it sounds like they won't and from what i understand that the test of the premier league applies to potential uh purchases of football clubs there's no real um human rights test um and then in fact amnesty had been lobbying the premier league to adopt such a test so you can't just have any old person buying a football club um i mean look we wouldn't accept the dictatorship in syria by newcastle united we all know what the dictatorship in syria is guilty of um and amnesty is saying that there needs to be a specific test to block these sorts of people from from exploiting british sport and exploiting these clubs for their own for their own ends um it looks like the premier league are going to wave it through and one of the reasons apparently from reading the reports this morning and last night that the premier league are going to wave it through is that they've been persuaded of the argument that's been made that the public investment fund the saudi sovereign wealth fund which is going to be the major shareholder in newcastle united going forward they've been persuaded by the argument that the public investment fund is not is a separate entity an autonomous entity from the saudi regime i'm afraid this is just nonsense it's laughable and any expert on the saudi regime on the political economy of saudi arabia will tell you that the sovereign wealth fund is is a tool of the regime its chairman is mohammed bin salman the guy who's been accused of the body americans of of being complicit in the murder of jamal khashoggi of ordering the murder of jamal khashoggi um he's the chairman of the public investment fund which apparently is going to be the major shareholder in newcastle united and that sovereign wealth fund is really the center of his entire economic strategy over the last five or six years the idea that is separate from the regime is just a nonsense but the premier league apparently are going to argue that it is separate and that's how they get this whole deal through and past their fit and proper person tax okay dr david wearing we'll leave it there interesting to talk to you today thank you very much,"The discussion centers around the recent acquisition of Newcastle United by the Saudi regime. It is argued that the purchase is not driven by a love for football or concern for the community but primarily serves the purpose of sportswashing—using sports to enhance the public image of authoritarian regimes globally. Examples related to China, Russia, Qatar, and the UAE are cited to illustrate similar patterns. Additionally, the acquisition signifies geopolitical strategies, as investments in Western economies like the UK and the US help cement relationships with key global powers, potentially securing support on geopolitical issues such as the war in Yemen. The dialogue also critiques the narrative of reform within Saudi Arabia, noting that while economic adjustments are underway to stabilize the regime's power, political and civil liberties remain severely restricted. Instances such as the imprisonment and alleged torture of women's rights activists are mentioned as evidence contrary to the reform rhetoric. Amnesty International's unsuccessful lobbying for the Premier League to block the sale due to the human rights record is highlighted, as well as the Premier League's decision to proceed with the sale after being convinced that Saudi's Public Investment Fund (PIF) is autonomous from the regime. However, skepticism is voiced about this claim, highlighting that the fund is chaired by Mohammad bin Salman, implicated in grave human rights issues including the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The Premier League's acceptance of the argument that the PIF is separate allows the deal to pass through their regulations, despite criticisms.",Sportswashing,-1,No,Newcastle United ownership,Saudi Arabia
fqWP6Eao8qk,Newcastle United takeover is OFF after Saudi-Arabian consortium pulls out of bid,huge breaking news this afternoon on a sky sports news exclusive the proposed takeover of newcastle is off the salary-led investment group and their partners have withdrawn their offer for the club the funds say the decision has been taken due to the prolonged process combined with the global uncertainty around long-term investments contracts were exchanged 17 weeks ago on a 300 million pound deal with the saudi public investment fund pcp capital partners and the ruben brothers now the investment group issued the following statement with a deep appreciation for the newcastle community and the significance of its football club we have come to the decision to withdraw our interest in acquiring newcastle united football club we do so with regret as we were excited and fully committed to invest in the great city of newcastle and believe we could have returned the club to the position of its history tradition and fans merit unfortunately the prolonged process under circumstances coupled with global uncertainty has rendered the potential investment no longer commercially viable to that end we feel a responsibility to the fans to explain the lack of alternatives from an investment perspective as an autonomous and purely commercial investor our focus was on building long-term value for the club its fans and the community as we remain committed to collaboration practicality and proactivity through a difficult period of global uncertainty and significant challenges for the fans on the club ultimately during the unforeseeably long process a prolonged process the commercial agreement between the investment group and the club's owners expired and our investment thesis could not be sustained particularly with no clarity as the circumstances under which the next season will start and the new norms that will arise for matches training and other activities as often occurs with proposed investments in uncertain periods time itself became an enemy of the transaction particularly during this difficult phase marked by the many real challenges facing us all from covid19 we feel great compassion for the newcastle united fans with whom we shared a great commitment to help newcastle united harness its tremendous potential and build upon its impressive and historic legacy while working closely with the local community we would like to say that we truly appreciated your incredible expressions of support and your patience throughout this process we are sorry it is not to be we wish the team and everyone associated with it much good luck and success right well carvey solidle joins us on set with a little bit more about this this was of course a sky sports news exclusive we're the first to bring you the news the first to bring you that lengthy statement as well carvey why was this takeover in doubt from the start well i think the first thing we should say is just to explain why newcastle united fans feel so deflated this afternoon if this takeover had gone through they would have become the richest club in the premier league the saudi back takeover when you look at their wealth they would have been 15 times richer than manchester city for instance crown prince mohammed bin salman is worth 30 times more than roman abramovich so this is what newcastle united and their supporters have lost this afternoon now as you rightly said this proposed takeover has been fraught with problems and difficulties from day one why is that well simply because football is a global business this was not a simple football deal this was almost a country buying a football club and that country is saudi arabia and it has some very controversial laws and it has a pretty poor record by western standards when it comes to human rights so the problems to begin with there were two main problems the first one was to do with human rights the second one was the whole issue of piracy when we're talking about human rights for instance we need to talk about the case of the dissident journalist jamal khashoggi who two years ago he was a journalist based in washington he walked into the saudi consulate in istanbul to get some paper work signed off to do with his marriage inside the saudi consulate in istanbul he was murdered and dismembered now according to the united nations crown prince mohammed bin salman the ruler of saudi arabia who is also in charge of saudi arabia's public investment fund which were going to own 80 which were 80 backing this takeover he was individually liable for this murder this murder was big news all over the world people were asking is he really an appropriate person to own a football club obviously that is one of the things the premier league have been looking at to do with their owners and directors tests for the past 16 weeks the second issue as far as the premier league are concerned is piracy now in the middle east in that region the rights to show premier league games are owned by a broadcaster called be in sport now in saudi arabia b in sport is blocked and premier league games have been shown on a pirate network called be out q now the world trade organization believes that blq is backed by the saudi government so yet again you can see problems would it be appropriate for a government a country who are showing premier league games illegally to also own a premier league club so those are the two main issues uh from day one human rights and also piracy now we've seen this afternoon that the consortium have backed out the paperwork was lodged with the premier league 16 17 weeks ago and the premier league still has not given the go ahead for that deal to go through so what appears to have happened is that the consortium have run out of patience and that is why they've pulled out of the deal and that is why they released the statement that you read a few minutes ago let's talk to our northeast reporter keith downey keith uh i know you're not a newcastle fan but this news probably has then made your life very difficult up there have you heard anything from the premier league or indeed from newcastle um well tom obviously this this news has just come as a slash i think a lot of us were kind of half expecting potentially one of the the two parties to pull out given the length of time this had gone on 17 long weeks the newcastle united fans have been waiting and we even had yesterday from a couple of local mps here who wrote to richard masters the chief executive of the premier league asking him to make a decision because it was affecting the supporters mental health that is the state it has got to up here in the northeast we have contacted newcastle united uh for comment in the last half an hour since we broke that story at 3 30. and i can tell you that a high level source at the club has told us that nobody at newcastle united were aware at all that this news was going to break today including the person that is handling all the affairs with regards to the takeover now there's a bit of a misconception that it's mike ashley who is handling things all things take over concern but it's actually has trusted lieutenant justin barnes uh who has been doing that and justin barnes himself was unaware that this news uh was going to break and only learnt of that when they saw the news flash up on sky sports news at c30 we've had no confirmation interestingly from the premier league as to whether this would have passed or failed i think we will never know whether this takeover this 300 million pound plus takeover would have passed or failed by the premier league and in many ways it's stopped making a decision obviously they've sat on this tom as you know for 17 weeks now it looked as though a decision for them was going to be very difficult so in many ways with the saudi back consortium pooling out of this it's kind of made the decision for them and made life yeah a little bit easier just just also on something cavi said a moment ago talking about um them being the saudis would make newcastle the richest club in the premier league with 15 times the wealth of manchester city i've always been unsure from the start if i'm honest um as to the level of backing and whenever we've spoken to the the would be buyers whenever we spoken to anyone involved with pif pcp they said that they were going to build newcastle united up slowly and not follow the identicate the way that manchester city have so it would have been interesting to see i think the newcastle united fans were dreaming of it happening even when the news that henry maurice the american millionaire was was plotting a bid to buy the club a few weeks ago and was announced all the supporters i spoke to the time said oh no he's not got enough money to buy newcastle united it's the saudis they want now they became attached to this dream they were living by it they were desperate for it to happen it is the worst news that they could have had this afternoon that the saudis have pulled out so a lot of people questioning now um is the takeover definitely off well it has to be off because without a buyer a willing buyer and a willing seller this isn't going to happen and sadly for the newcastle united supporters the willing buyer has just pulled out yeah that's even more interesting isn't it keith no newcastle expected this to happen today keith thanks very much,"The transcript discusses the withdrawal of the Saudi-led consortium's takeover bid for Newcastle United Football Club. The group, comprising Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), PCP Capital Partners, and the Reuben brothers, cited a prolonged process and global investment uncertainties as reasons for the decision. The investment group expressed regret as they were committed to investing in Newcastle and helping the club regain its historical position. The transcript details the potential impact of the takeover, noting that Newcastle could have become the richest club in the Premier League, significantly wealthier than clubs like Manchester City. However, the bid faced several issues, primarily related to human rights concerns and piracy. The assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, allegedly linked to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the head of PIF, was a significant human rights concern, raising questions about appropriate club ownership. Additionally, the piracy of Premier League games in Saudi Arabia, via networks allegedly supported by the government, posed an ethical issue. Despite the papers being with the Premier League for 16 weeks, no decision had been made, and the consortium withdrew out of frustration. Newcastle fans, disheartened by the news, were optimistic about the potential Saudi involvement, hoping for club revitalization similar to Manchester City's under wealthy ownership. The broader context includes the Consortium's claim of willing slow, sustainable growth, contrary to the aggressive spending of clubs like Manchester City. A local report highlighted the mental health impacts on fans due to the drawn-out process. The Premier League's lack of comment adds ambiguity to whether the takeover would have passed. Despite aspirations and dreams linked to the takeover among Newcastle supporters, the deal's collapse dashed hopes of a transformative change for the club.",Sportswashing,-1,No,Newcastle United ownership,Saudi Arabia
Ss3-fVMOwXU,I challenge Newcastle fans protesting against our clubs Saudi owners,there's a Newcastle United fans group behind me are part of a silent protest who are against the Newcastle United ownership the Saudi ownership because of allegations of sports Washington human rights abuses the persecution of the lb TQ plus Community beheadings uh the persecution and subjugation of women in all sorts it's causing quite uncontroversy a lot of angry people around here um but I'm going to go across I'm going to give them a bit of a grueling ask some tough questions and find out what's going on it's coming up obviously a lot of controversy with um the protest um so what are you hoping to achieve by role well I don't I mean I'm not the group organizer but from my point of view I think it's really raising awareness for us and Newcastle supporter about where the investment has come from into the club the uh the human rights abuses which are taking place and I think um it's a wonderful thing what's happening on a pitch it's exciting it's exciting everything you feel here and see is absolutely amazing everything Eddie Howe's doing and I'm a big support of the club but I can't really sit now really thinking about where the money has come from and where yeah what the club stands for and I think for them if people have a conscience really if Newcastle friends have a conscience they you can't really Park that side I think you've got to say something about it if people do it fair enough enjoy the football but if anyone has any disquiet about it I think better to to speak out and say something than not so that's but I mean how do you know that Newcastle fans on speaking out I mean they are generally and this is this is why we're here I think I think to be honest with a lot of people like me who are in a very difficult position where they grew up the match they love a club they want to support the clip I want to be in there I've got a season ticket I've given it up from the season um I would love to be in there with them and I don't blame anyone who is and I think a lot of people are in two minds about this a lot of people are probably uncomfortable with the way the way what the club means and how this is portraying the club further nothing that's it's it's a big issue um I would love to see some statement from the club from good UC from from Steve about what it means I mean I don't think anybody agrees with our Dune I don't agree with the subjugation of women yeah I don't agree with the persecution of the lbtq plus Community I don't agree with beheadings I don't agree with the treatment of some some of their citizens and I'm sure ninety percent of the people who are walking past feel exactly the same absolutely but yeah you know um people are aware and the owners who have taken over Newcastle aren't trying to impose their religious ideologies in fact in fact the opposite they're helping to promote women's football for example there's a kind of a contradiction I'm not you know it's it wouldn't be it's not fair from any fan from bike elzig band will it show their you know the whole um moral responsibility of what's happening in another country and that's not what we're asking um what the you know what's Dave Lee and geducia are doing here in Newcastle up to your fantastic reason awareness about where the money comes from but it's on behalf of the show the ownership that they're doing that not just Amanda the Saudi ownership I mean it's our investment and then doing it it's purely an investment from them it's purely investment I don't think I don't know how much they care about that I think it's what happens abroad that counts if this if if the club could make any statements about that about about uh whether the investment's coming from what's happening in Saudi Arabia I think finally okay be aware be aware also a lot a lot of fans have some um have a conscience and have some um some anxiety about what's happening now that the term of Human Rights it can be a bit of a sunbait because of course Saudi Arabia haven't subscribed or signed up to the Human Rights Act no they haven't you can't change someone else's culture and that's not what it's about and and I don't think they would want to want to change ours but they're buying into it they're buying into it in a massive way and uh when you look at things like the um the cafala you look at them the the substantial human rights abuses that are taking place the the well they're not human rights abuses they're not in the part of the Human Rights Convention they have a religious ideology based on Sharia law I don't agree with it but it's there deeply entrenched religious philosophy to do what do you think is the the word of God God's instructing them to do that so who who are we in the west to interfere with though absolutely who who are we but if they're buying into your club and you're identifying with them as Newcastle fan you're wearing a shirt are you identifying with that that's where the money's coming from and it's it's their culture and we're benefiting from it now we're the beneficiaries of this so um I agree we're not we we kind of change their culture but it's it's it's to raise awareness to his questions about it and I appreciate everything you've said agree with that Buddha also as well I mean it's hard to do things like this by Sometimes some people I'm not suggesting you can be a bit hypocritical I mean if if you're on Facebook drive going to know about taxi during Starbucks Coffee watch Disney movies and go to concerts disagree I don't think people who take part in to live in Modern Life and to drive a car just because you need to put Petrol in your car it doesn't mean that you're supporting your regime however exactly what's the point that's a fair point yeah well this is specific this is about someone buying into our club if you're wearing the badge if you're now wearing a white shirt and a green badge I think that means something and I think that's slightly different to it Greg how do you feel about that got a group behind us I'm totally against them yet at the end of the day it's just because just because we're from the west and we're supposed to be a civilized country who are we to tell them which laws and rules they should have it's there couldn't be at the end of the day it's got 100 with us it's a football club they shouldn't be here in my eyes man 100 they shouldn't be here putting Petrol in the car going to Disneyland doing all these things I think it's a bit of a wash I would say if you if you want to take part in Modern Life you're buying into in a capitalism and everything like that I mean everyone does I've not got a problem with that I'm just highlighting it a hypocritical side of it you're a problem I'm just just saying I appreciate these questions about hypocrisy this is questions about double standards in life and and you know now don't blame any single fan walking past wanting to go into the game support the club taking part in a terrific atmosphere isn't it I would be there myself absolutely love it but I think if you've got a conscience you've got to raise questions and then but you suggestion that people have no conscience the heart or a conscience and I'm not saying I'm completely happy I mean there is an element of discomfort absolutely um absolutely good um do you keep their business in Saudi Arabia they're not interfering with us they don't because I don't think the money's the money's here the investment that you see in the club is from that and they they don't give their business there the vine the bank you know they're buying into the club they're buying they're now part of the Newcastle United brand and that's that that's a difference I think yeah indeed I think as well if I'm working in collaboration with a company like Saudi Arabia will rise and Tide rears as All Ships I'm sure those things we can learn from their society from a personal point of view and I'm not I'm not the organizable group I'm not saying kick try and kick them out and what I'm saying is raise awareness and ask the questions make sure that you know it's an issue that a lot of Newcastle fans have as you see a lot of fans have a conscience and it's not fair for them to carry the the moral responsibility for this um but but yeah it's just about raising awareness and I think um I think that's the most important thing so what is your ultimate aim today what are you trying to change you'd have to ask the organizer John um about what his overall want is for me I would just like um stevely and uh to know that um there are a lot of fans who do have a substantial amount disquiet there's been a lot there portrayal in the National media that Newcastle fans simply don't care they've embraced that thing is we've been starved for investment and money and excitement and ambition by Ashley for years this was ripe to happen and um I don't blame anyone for it um I wanted to support my club um I think it's really just making sure that godusi and them safely are aware in terms of them you know the conscience of support that's having the questions that they want to raise nothing after from my point of view yeah,"The transcript is centered around a silent protest by a group of Newcastle United fans against the club's ownership by Saudi investors. The fans are protesting due to concerns about sportswashing and human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia, including issues like persecution of the LGBTQ+ community, beheadings, and women's subjugation. The protest aims to raise awareness among fans about the origins of the investment in the club and the ethical dilemmas it presents. The dialogue captures the conflicted feelings of Newcastle supporters who love their club but grapple with the moral implications of its ownership. While the club's performance and investment in areas like women's football are highlighted positively, the broader ethical concerns remain a point of contention. The transcript touches on themes like cultural differences, Western intervention, and personal responsibility, questioning whether fans should be accountable for the actions of their club's owners. The discussion also addresses accusations of hypocrisy and double standards in modern life, such as the idea that consuming products linked to unethical practices equates to endorsing them. Ultimately, the protest emphasizes increasing awareness and sparking dialogue about these complex issues among fans and owners.",Sportswashing,-1,No,Newcastle United ownership,Saudi Arabia

It highlights how Saudi Arabia has utilized its ownership of Newcastle United and investments in football to improve its global image, a strategy often referred to as sportswashing. The transcript references ongoing protests by fans and activists, including Newcastle Fans Against Sportswashing, who oppose the Saudi government's actions, such as the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the imprisonment of human rights activists. Despite legal assurances from the Premier League that the Saudi state wouldn't control Newcastle, revelations have emerged connecting Yasir Al-Rumayyan, a Saudi government minister, to the club. The transcript notes Saudi Arabia's broader goal to diversify its economy through Vision 2030, with sports as a key part. It juxtaposes the political implications of such sports events against the local reactions; for some Newcastle fans and attending spectators, the focus remains on football without engaging in the political discourse, reflecting the complexities of modern football where investments often intertwine with politics.",Sportswashing,-1,No,Newcastle United ownership,Saudi Arabia
OMTszkzVSx4,"WHY rich regimes are ruining football | Newcastle, Man City, PSG and Bayern Munich",sponsors are everywhere in football on the front of the club shirt on the back of it even on the sleeves logos appear at the side of the pitch and on the backdrops for post-match interviews it's no secret that sponsorship and sports go hand in hand and the equation is simple clubs need money to build stadiums to buy players to be competitive and remain relevant in return sponsors get to put their logos everywhere and market their products so it makes sense for them but why are dictatorships doing the same why are countries investing in football there's more to sponsorship than just economics how different would it be if we exactly knew what's truly behind the money many countries especially those with authoritarian governments have been heavily spending in football governments know that investing money in sports can make them look good it's what's known as sports washing sports washing which is to say the attempt by a government to whitewash to cleanse to project a more positive image of itself than is accurate really an alternative version of events as it were this is nothing new sport is powerful and it can be it can be used for nefarious ends if you're looking at how governments have used sport yeah i would say the sport has always been used i mean you could go further back back into roman times so look at how sport's been used to um you know to serve a political purpose it's a way for oppressive governments to rebrand themselves qatar is one of the best examples the tiny but oil-rich gulf state has spent millions not only buying a team but bankrolling its record transfers founding a sports tv channel and even obtaining the rights to host a world cup tournament but it's a different story behind the scenes the country has been accused of multiple human rights violations qatar has a serious problem like the other gulf states is the violation of migrant workers rights the treatment of migrant workers in the gulf and in qatar is is abominable some people have talked about it being a form of modern day slavery and this has become far more visible because of its successful bid to host the 2022 world cup uh they brought in you know hundreds of thousands millions of migrant workers to make that possible essentially overhauling their entire infrastructure and building a lot of new football stadiums the question of the guest workers is definitely a complex question there is no question about our commitment when it comes to their rights there has been over the years plenty of questions about your commitment and fair enough i mean those were basically based on some media campaigns et cetera but they're based on the truth no no they're based on the lousy conditions in which these migrant workers and we acknowledge that and we acknowledge that as a matter of fact the most recent amnesty international report we have welcomed that human rights watch are welcome to doha on regular basis and we receive their criticism very well despite pressure from the international community qatar's atrocious human rights record continues but its financial muscle has caused many countries to look the other way so even if you want to ignore all these problems let's say you're just a football fan and you only care about football well they're also destroying the sport as we know it too let's dig deeper qatar's first major involvement in football was back in 2011 when they bought paris saint-germain and started pumping millions to bring talon to the french capital most notably orchestrating the two most expensive transfers in world football to date these massive expenditures have translated to psg's domination of french football the club have been crowned league champion seven times in the past eight years the french league well some say it's a joke this is a big part of the investment of qatar investing in paris in denmark because today i wanna see everybody talk about personal mind about qatar you know so i think it's it's something give big huge exposure and these ridiculous sums of money have turned the transfer market on its head meaning that fewer clubs will be able to keep up and compete psg also hold winter training camps in qatar but rather than benefit from warm weather training the trip works more to showcase the country don't forget qatar's main goal isn't having the world's best football team it's cleaning up their image so the country has also invested in other teams take fc barcelona they proudly boasted having a 111 year tradition of not having a paid shirt sponsor but that all changed in 2011 once qatar offered the club 150 million euros to display the name of the middle eastern country for five seasons [Music] is it really worth all that money and qatar there's no doubt there's so much loyalty in football that once we get associated with a football club it will boost our passenger appeal and at the same time it will give us the the footprint to expand our footprint into other parts of the world where we are preparing to go qatar have gone on to sponsor the shirts of italian side roma and belgian club oyben but perhaps the country's most important shirt sponsorship deal at the moment is with german giants bayern munich qatar airways the state-owned airline pay bayern 10 million euros a year and in return the club fly to doha for mid-season training camps they've been doing so since 2011. some bayern supporters have a big problem with that they're against their club being linked with qatar due to the country's human rights record during matches fans have held banners protesting the club's dealings with the country and that's happened on multiple locations they haven't just expressed this discontent you know they've become actively involved in these issues they've held events they've spoken to councillors in munich they've attempted to engage the club directly on these issues with very clear asks and what they want the club to do but for the club's higher-ups it's business as usual going as far as defending their position partner from cathars is yeah it's not true it's dangerously untrue the reality is that um you know it's killed because of migrant workers so when people like roman put these lines out there it's dangerous it'd be far more helpful if they would have a more realistic assessment of the problem or indeed if they would use the influence to actually call for reforms that would help migrant workers and we don't even need to travel far from qatar to find the next case of sports washing their neighbors in the middle east abu dhabi and the united arab emirates was even a step ahead as they bought premier league side manchester city back in 2008. [Music] the abu dhabi united group transformed the club overnight into the world's richest football club the emirate has spent more than 1 billion pounds in transfers since buying the club the investment has been controversial even until today regarding uefa's financial fair play rules but the cash has delivered positive results on the pitch man city have won four premier league titles since just like qatar the uae isn't interested in financial profit they're after something else the emirate has virtually zero democracy and has repressive freedom of speech loss ninety percent of the population are migrants and the vast majority of them are paid the bare minimum and live in poor conditions manchester city's success gives abu dhabi a chance to offer an alternative story about the country to the rest of the world the country paints itself as a top holiday destination that's also quite easy to do when you know football stars from all over europe vacation there today abu dhabi's investment in man city has turned into something bigger city football group which owns different clubs across the globe city football group gives abu dhabi a platform to consolidate and strengthen their political influence we have an ambition as a as a football group to to have an organization that that is global and that that will have multiple clubs as part of it so i i would say when the opportunity rises and we are looking at opportunities you can expect us also to add to the number of clubs we have already within within the organization all of their clubs were similar colors have similar batches they even have the same sponsor etihad airways and that's just one of two of the uae's state-owned airlines they're both making big moves in football emirates is going after the european elites real madrid the world's most famous and most successful club [Music] what's undershirt emirates the dubai based airline has a myriad of sponsorships in football besides being real madrid's main sponsor emirates has deals with clubs such as ac milan benfica and arsenal emirates have the longest running sponsorship deal in the premier league as they have sponsored arsenal since 2006. the club's home ground even bears the airline's name the emirates stadium and that won't change anytime soon the stadium's naming rights will last until 2028. you may imagine that arsenal fans would be one of the groups of supporters who might protest against the involvement of emirates so it's not like the government of dubai owns arsenal it partly relates to the fact that dubai's international reputation has been normalized over many years long before the term sports washing was coined and frankly that's the best case scenario for these type of sponsors arsenal fans have gotten so used to the name throughout the years that it's almost synonymous with their club the logo no longer represents what it once did it is seen in a positive light by a large majority arsenal have welcomed the money as they've been able to buy star players making a lot of arsenal fans happy one of those fans is rwandan president paul kagame who often tweets his views on the club although rwanda is one of the poorest countries in the world and receives financial aid from the european union the african country signed a sponsorship deal worth millions with arsenal since 2018 visit rwanda has been displayed on the sleeves of the arsenal shirts rwanda have defended the agreement saying rwanda's economy will benefit from tourism as part of the deal arsenal players hold training camps in rwanda and the country's logo appears at the side of the pitch the asuna club takes a message with them that rwanda is a place that is at peace with itself and other africans and ready for investments according to human rights watch freedom of expression as well as freedom of the press in rwanda is very limited critics of kagame who has been in power for more than 20 years say the deal is an example of an autocrat indulging a private passion while subsidizing one of the richest clubs in world football they argue that the nation could have found a better use for the money whatever people say they are entitled to say that but i'm also entitled to do whatever i think benefits my country despite criticism the african country inked a new deal at the end of 2019 this time with a new club none other than qatar's paris saint-germain this is a move that is strictly for their benefits strictly for job creation strictly for economic growth uh strictly for improving the export you know strictly improving the image and the perception of the country so this is a trend this is this is not just about the gulf states i think it's reasonable to to point to them as perhaps the most obvious example and the most naked example of sports washing but they're by no means the only dangerous actors getting involved it's even affecting the game's governing bodies ever heard of so-car since 2013 they have been partners with uefa the old company belongs to the small country of azerbaijan which has been ruled by the aliyah family since the early 90s however uefa insists that they sign a contract with sokkar and not the state of azerbaijan but in reality there's very little to set them apart the company makes up 90 of the country's exports and the revenues account for half the national budget azerbaijan also sponsors spanish club atletico madrid from 2012 through 2014. its capital baku hosted the 2019 europa league final with both finalists chelsea and arsenal being based in london that meant most fans had to travel about 4 000 kilometers to attend the match an expensive logistical nightmare unlike most finals it was not sold out is that the atmosphere uefa want in football not the best way of showcasing the old rich country azerbaijan could learn a thing or two from russia when it comes to sports washing russia are leading the way and they do it through the gas company gaspron on paper gazprom is a private company but since 2005 the russian government has owned more than half of the company's shares bundesliga side schalke have a long-standing deal with the russian company the sponsorship was first established in 2007 in a deal worth a hundred and fifty million euros gazprom also owns russian club senate saint petersburg the old conglomerate bought the club in 2005 making the club a major force in russian football gazprom's investment meant cine could make significant moves in the transfer market bringing in players like claudio marquisio axel vitzell hulk and most recently malcolm i think it is the ownership model that we have to be more worried about when these states take full control of football clubs and use them for political ends that's i think when existential issues come into play by which i mean are they going to ruin clubs and are they going to ruin the game more generally gazprom uses the club and its players for multiple pr stunts such as having them play football on an offshore drilling rig these images help glorify gaspron's arctic expeditions and downplay the environmental impact caused by all extraction as well as owning and pumping money into clubs gazprom is also a major player in the champions league the partnership with uefa began in 2012 and it was extended until 2021 russia knows how to play the game the 2018 world cup powered by none other than gasprom was russia's crown jewel what you saw in the run-up to 2018 was a lot of coverage of what was happening in russia a lot of coverage of the rights abuses a lot of interest in that a lot of engagement in it and i think what the categories will have noticed was how that all vanished as soon as the first whistle blew and i think everyone became captivated by the football the catholics know that if they can just get to that first whistle then they're they're over the line and then they'll look to hold a successful tournament um to to cement their reputation and they hope that they'll get a reputational bounce from that and history would suggest that they will so what do you think is sports watching a big problem in football or is it just the future tell us in the comments [Music] [Music],"The transcript explores the intricate relationship between football sponsorships and sportswashing, highlighting how authoritarian regimes leverage sports investments to project a positive image internationally. It begins by explaining the commonplace nature of sponsorships in football and progresses to question why authoritarian regimes are so heavily involved in the sport. It emphasizes the concept of sportswashing, which involves countries attempting to sanitize their image through associations with sports. The text discusses Qatar, focusing on its significant investments in Paris Saint-Germain, the 2022 World Cup, and other clubs, despite ongoing human rights allegations concerning migrant workers. The document also covers Abu Dhabi's investment in Manchester City, illustrating how such financial backing has strengthened its geopolitical influence and reshaped the club's financial and competitive landscape. Additionally, the transcript examines the involvement of other nations like Rwanda and Azerbaijan in sports sponsorships, illustrating similar patterns of using football to enhance national images. It delves into the controversy surrounding such investments, especially when linked to human rights abuses and political regimes, and describes the mixed reactions among club fans. Russian company Gazprom's relationship with football, particularly the Champions League, is highlighted as an example of how nations often tied to political and ethical controversies utilize sports investments to shift perceptions. The discussion raises questions about the ethical implications of such investments, whether they harm the integrity of football, and whether they represent a distraction from more significant issues like human rights abuses. The transcript concludes by inviting opinions on whether sportswashing signifies a fundamental problem in football or an inevitable future trend.",Sportswashing,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar
hFw-GYAlJHc,Why Saudi Arabia wants all the sports,"- In Northeastern England, there is a football club
called Newcastle United. It joined the English Football
League way back in 1893, and then won several
trophies in the early 1900s. In 1955, it won the English
League's top trophy, but since then it hasn't won a thing. It was bought and sold by
several generations of owners, but none of them could bring success. All the while its fans grew frustrated. In 2021, Newcastle was
hovering near the bottom of the English Premier League when suddenly everything changed. (crowd cheering) - [Announcer] The English
Premier League's Newcastle United has been acquired by Saudi Arabia's multi-billion dollar
sovereign wealth fund. - It was a huge deal
for New Castle United, but just the tip of the
iceberg for Saudi Arabia. Over the past several years, the country has spent at least
$10 billion on sports teams, events and sponsorships
in soccer, auto racing, boxing, wrestling and golf. Many are claiming that Saudi
Arabia's spending spree is simply sportswashing. - I wonder if you could define for us what is sportswashing. - Sportswashing is the
deployment of sports for the purpose of cleansing a country's image and reputation. - Adolf Hitler did it in 1936
by hosting the Olympic Games while persecuting Jews and minorities. Argentina's military junta did it in 1978 by hosting the FIFA World Cup while killing thousands of dissidents. And Vladimir Putin did it in 2014 and 2018 as he repressed dissent at
home and started wars abroad. Today, the leaders of Saudi
Arabia frequently jail and execute anyone who
speaks out against them, harshly suppress women's and gay rights, and in recent years, murdered
a prominent journalist and have orchestrated
a bloody war in Yemen. Plenty of reasons to want to
sports wash, but they insist that they're using sports
for economic reasons. - If the sportwashing can
increase my GDP volume bu 1%, then we will continue doing sportwashing. - So which is it? - If people are going to think that this is just sportswashing, well then you're missing the vast majority of what Saudi Arabia's actually doing. - This is about preserving their status. Saudi Arabia knows that
the clock is now ticking. (upbeat contemporary music) - The modern country of Saudi Arabia has always been ruled by
one family, the Al Saud. In the 1930s, they conquered the region with help from members
of the Wahhabi movement, an ultra-conservative sect of Islam. The Al Saud then became absolute
monarchs of Saudi Arabia while enforcing the
strict laws of Wahhabism on their population. They harshly enforced dress codes, prayer attendance and gender segregation. Women were subordinated to
men and given very few rights. - Sunni Islam really seeped into society for a very long time and
that was in many ways done by the state. - Karim Zidan is a journalist covering the intersection
of sports and geopolitics. - You had these morality
police on the streets with these little sticks
and then basically policing how you could behave in Saudi Arabia. - But while the Al Saud
regime rose to power thanks to religion, they've been able to
hold onto it thanks to. - [Announcer] Oil, millions
and millions of tons have already been pumped
out, but it's been estimated that half the world's known
reserves of crude oil still lie beneath this barren featureless desert. - Since the mid 20th century, Saudi Arabia has been selling more oil than any other country, and in exchange for supplying
many countries with oil, the regime receives two things
that help it stay in power. Firstly, it earns hundreds of
billions of dollars every year which it uses to support its citizens. The Saudi government pays for
their healthcare, education, and provides them jobs, and
for years didn't tax them. This was a way to keep them
dependent on the regime. Supplying oil has also
given Saudi Arabia influence with many countries, which it's
used to secure their support and in some cases, protection. - [Announcer] It is the
giant of the oil world, and that means more money,
more power, and more influence on the affairs of our time. - Wealth and influence
abroad has given the regime a secure grip on power, so secure that it hasn't
really developed other parts of its economy. - Let's put it in kind of blunt terms. If if you don't have to work
too hard, you just pull it out of the ground and sell
it and you get rich. There's no real incentive to innovate, to be enterprising, to diversify. - Simon Chadwick is a professor of sport and geopolitical economy at the Skema Business School in Paris. - This is a massive overdependence upon one particular commodity. - But for the Al Saud, it works until the day
people stop buying oil. - Today's search party

prices are collapsing. Senior oil executive
has cast serious doubt over Saudi Arabia's oil capacity. - While models vary about
how quickly demand for oil will decline, most predict
that demand will slow in the late 2020s. Since Saudi Arabia is so
heavily dependent on oil, even a modest decline in oil demand means. - Their economy is in trouble. They're in big trouble. - Less demand for oil means
less influence abroad, less money to support its citizens, and therefore a less secure grip on power. - We're talking about 20 years maybe for Saudi Arabia to turn round. You are in essence, a
super tanker of an economy. - In other words, 20
years to fill these gaps. In 2015, the king of Saudi
Arabia named his son, Mohammed bin Salman, the
country's defacto leader, and in many ways MBS, as he's known, is another ruthless Saudi leader. He launched a bloody war in Yemen, imposed a blockade on Qatar and kidnapped Lebanon's Prime Minister, and in 2018, he directed his
personal bodyguards to murder Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist
critical of the regime. He's also cracking down hard
on dissent within Saudi Arabia and his regime's use of the
death penalty has almost doubled under his reign. But unlike his predecessors,
MBS has dramatically scaled back the influence
of Wahhabi Islam. He gave Saudi women the
right to drive, get jobs, and travel alone. He weakened the powers
of the morality police, and he's permitting music
festivals, movie theaters and other social events in
Saudi Arabia for the first time. But MBS isn't giving his
citizens more rights just because he feels it's the right thing to do. - There is a hard bottom
line in all of this which is if you have 50% of your population sat
at home doing nothing, then you are economically inefficient. - MBS needs the whole Saudi
population to help him build a new economy. (upbeat music) At the heart of MBS's Vision
2030 Plan is a $700 billion sovereign wealth fund called the PIF. Its task is to invest money in new ways for Saudi Arabia to generate
wealth and influence. So far, we know it's invested 933 million in a housing complex in Riyadh, eight and a half billion
dollars in tourism development by the Red Sea and $500
billion in a brand new high-tech city called Neom. These are ways the regime is
trying to build new industries that can provide its citizens
income, housing, and jobs. The PIF has also invested
billions in companies around the world, particularly in the U.S. The Saudis are hoping that the returns from these investments can be of course, a new source of income,
but more importantly, a way to build influence
in other countries. - Some people might term it diplomacy. Other people might term it lobbying, but certainly this is nothing new. - What is new is how well
sports fit into this puzzle. - I'm over the moon, mate's best day ever. I'm over the moon, a long time coming. (fans shouting) - I've got hope back. - After paying 391 million for
majority stake in Newcastle, The PIF spent millions
more to sign new players. Newcastle then finished fourth
in 2022 and secured a spot in the lucrative Champions
League Tournament. - [Announcer] A Champions League
place assure that the team that was staring down
the barrel of relegation not that long ago. - Buying Newcastle cost The
Saudis far less than many of its other outside
investments, and it's unlikely to make them much profit,
but that's not the point. Buying Newcastle is an
effective way for the Saudis to build influence in the U.K. by first appealing to its fans. - Bold that they wanna see
really in the sports world, is their team succeed. And suddenly out of the blue, you've got this magnanimous
leader who decides, you know what? I like your team. I'm gonna invest in it. I'm gonna make you guys one of
the best teams in the world. Of course it's gonna
earn a sense of loyalty from the average sports
fan who's not in this to think of the geopolitics
and the bigger narrative. - The Saudis know that
fan loyalty can grow into much wider influence
because they've been watching their neighbors do it for years. The Emirate of Abu Dhabi purchased the Manchester City Football Club in 2008, and Qatar purchased Paris
St. Germain in 2011. Both spent millions to improve
their clubs and are now enjoying both economic
and political influence. - You take Manchester in
the U.K., that has resulted in significant infrastructural development in downtown Manchester
funded by Abu Dhabi. Whether it's Uber, Facebook,
or indeed, a soccer club or a major championship,
it does enable countries to exert their influence
and accumulate power. - Even though Saudi Arabia
realizes later than its neighbors it has far more money than them and can afford to buy
influence in many places. In 2021 and '22, it spent
$2 billion to create a whole new golf league and
millions more to sign several of the world's best golfers. It's now planning to merge
with a US-based PGA Tour. In 2021, it's invested $500
million to sponsor McLaren, a Formula One race car
manufacturer based in the U.K. And in 2023, Saudi Arabia
directed a state-owned company to buy a major sponsorship with AS Roma, a football club in Italy. Saudi Arabia is also
rumored to be interested in backing the ATP, which operates professional
tennis tournaments all over the world. By buying sports, Saudi
Arabia is buying influence. - We can't underestimate how
influential sports can be. The regional diplomacy is prestige. The soft power, although
with Saudi Arabia, it really does feel aggressive and hard. - But the Al Saud regime
also believes sports can be a new way to keep its
population under control. The vast majority of
Saudi Arabia's population is under the age of 35, and in 2022, 23% of them were unemployed. Not so long ago, this
combination spelled disaster for autocratic regimes nearby. (crowd chanting) - The average age of an
Arab spring protester was 26 years old. That Gen Z population is
an internal security threat for the ruling family. They potentially could become restless. They could start to make
demands of the ruling family. - You've gotta do something with them and feeding them entertainment
is at the end of the day, what was once known as bread and circuses. - Today, circuses means sports. - Ladies and gentlemen,
from King Abola Sports City here in Jetta, Saudi Arabia. - [Announcer] And the
Saudi Grand Prix is good. - [Announcer] It's
magnitude to Saudi Arabia. - Saudi Arabia spends 65
million a year to host a Formula One race, 141 million so far to host
heavyweight boxing matches, and a hundred million a year
to host WWE wrestling events. It hosts the world's richest horse race and won a bid to host the
2029 Winter Asian Games. Then in 2023, the PIF
took a majority ownership of four Saudi football
clubs and spent millions to sign several of the
world's best players. (alien music) Saudi Arabia submitted a bid
to host the 2034 FIFA World Cup and is reportedly interested
in hosting an Olympic games. Turning Saudi Arabia
into a sports paradise, MBS is hoping to keep the
population on his side. - A teenager in Saudi Arabia right now absolutely loves this man. Saudis love watching Italian
and and Spanish football, and now all these stars are
coming and playing not only in their league, but hosting
their tournaments here. Everything a Saudi kid
would've ever grown up wanting and knowing they couldn't
get in Saudi Arabia, now comes just like that. That is powerful, Mohammed
bin Salman knows that. (upbeat music) - So is this sportwashing? I think for me, really, it
depends where you're sat in the world. If you sat in, for example, Scandinavia, and you look at this, yes,
absolutely it's sportwashing. I know that people in the Gulf
region will look at people like us and they will say, well, you know, why do you hate us so much? We're just investing in
sport in the same way as you've invested in sport. So how come you see it as
being something divisive or something that's threatening? - The term sportswashing
falls short in this case because it ignores a major
reason why Saudi Arabia is spending so much money
on sports because it feels its future depends on it. Only by acknowledging
that can the countries and organizations that control sports realize the leverage they
now have to push for change. - We are living in the middle
of a massive negotiation. I think we will begin
to see possibly the U.S. and Europe be more protectionist and more guarded about sport. But at the same time, I
think if Saudi Arabia wants to set ascend to a position of
global legitimacy and power, then it will have to
compromise some of its values and compromise some of its beliefs. - So the world can either take advantage of this opportunity or sit
back and call it a distraction. Hey everybody, thanks again

(upbeat contemporary music)","The transcript provides an in-depth analysis of Saudi Arabia's extensive investments in global sports, particularly focusing on its acquisition of Newcastle United and other sports ventures. It discusses the historical context of sportswashing, likening current practices to notorious historical events where sports were used to improve countries' images amidst human rights abuses, such as by Nazi Germany, Argentina's military junta, and Russia under Putin. The transcript delves into Saudi Arabia's political history, its reliance on oil wealth, and the subsequent need to diversify its economy due to fluctuating oil demands. Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 aims to create new revenue streams and influence through the Public Investment Fund (PIF), while investing in international companies and sports teams to extend its geopolitical reach. By owning sports entities and hosting international events, Saudi Arabia seeks to cement political influence and control over its young population by diverting their attention to sports. The document balances the narrative by acknowledging the economic strategic motives of Saudi Arabia against allegations of sportswashing. It reflects on whether Saudi’s efforts constitute sportswashing or are genuine economic strategies, highlighting global perspectives which view the developments as either or both.",Sportswashing,-1,No,Newcastle United ownership,Saudi Arabia
l9XuvDXJlZI,"Saudi Sports Minister Prince Abdulaziz on Ronaldo, Salah, Trump & World Cup","a lot of people think that Saudi suppresses free speech and I think there's Merit to that argument in many ways you've made no effort to censor me I mean you couldn't because the show's called unsensitive do you think journalists are going to give the same scrutiny to US Canada and Mexico and their human rights records as you're going to get uh no but it is what it is Donald Trump is the president of the United States again is this a good thing that he's been reelected for you guys if he love sports yes would you be happy for Russia as things stand to compete in 2034 I mean that decision is with FIFA it's not with with us but we have no we don't mix politics with with sports at all the Taliban are going to stop women competing in sport then we shouldn't be encouraging playing the in the men's game what do you think I think the a shouldn't be a victim of political decisions we stand firmly with the Palestinian people but that has nothing to do with the sport football is obviously getting bigger and bigger here yeah like you should be thanking me really because without my interview with Cristiano Ronaldo that led to him leaving Manchester United he wouldn't be here president Trump's first phone call to another world leader wasn't to Historic allies like France or the UK nor was it to Ukraine zalinski Russia's Putin or Israel's Netanyahu with whom he's had urgent business on brokering an end of their deadly and unpopular Wars his first call in fact was about business of the kind he knows best investment trade and profit and the man at the end of the line was the Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salon of Saudi Arabia orad was Trump's first destination as president in 2017 and it may well end up being his first again in 2025 so first foreign trip typically has been with UK but we did it I did it with Saudi Arabia last time because they agreed to buy 450 billion worth of our product I said I'll do it but you have to buy American product and they agreed to do that they bought 450 billion it was the least reported story I've ever been involved in now or are you plan to go now well I don't know if Saudi Arabia wanted to buy another 450 or 500 we'll up it for all the inflation Saudi Arabia is now weighing up a 600 billion dollar investment in the United States but most of the big spending is at home the kingdom wants to be the world capital of sports and entertainment and has the money to match the vision well many top footballers have followed Cristiano Ronaldo to riat Major boxing balance and Dana White's UFC and now fixture here they're building it but will the world come I've never been to Saudi Arabia until now my first trip here despite many visits to other parts of the Middle East I've seen and read a lot about Saudi Arabia and judged only by Western media you might think it to be a Dusty dangerous place where misogyny rules and the people live in fear so I thought i' come and judge it for myself always a good idea when you read narratives which perhaps are a little distorted and well this is not a hostage video no one's telling me what I can and can't say I can go wherever I like I've been walking around quite happily on my own I've already met some very interesting people and crucially this is uncensored as it always is that's the basis of any country in Saudi Arabia they feel that way about their country this is Saudi Arabia we're the most important country in Islam you know we're the leader of the Arab world which they are they're very proud of it great I'm not a Muslim or an Arab not from the Middle East I come here they're like great so glad to have you by the way you're not allowed like change the laws here because you're not Saudi this country is changing fast that is for sure after years of living under Antiquity rules women can now work drive and move freely around the country they're welcome at concerts and in sports stadiums and they're embracing it plent of women and families alongside me to enjoy Al NASA's 31 victory at the weekend Ronaldo scored of course under the watchful eye of an old friend Ronaldo sport is at the heart of Saudi Arabia's plan to transform its economy and sport is driving much of the rapid and dramatic social change in 2034 it will host the biggest sporting contest of all the World Cup and the man charged with delivering it is Prince abdalaziz been turkey Alisal I sat with him in Riyad for a n hols Bard lengthy interview that I'm sure will make a lot of headlines everywhere nothing crucially was off limits this was genuinely uncensored claims about human rights abuses women's rights sportswashing he answered everything that I asked him but take a look and judge for yourself your roal hes uh it's great to meet you uh my first time in Saudi Arabia first time in Riad fascinating to be I've been here 24 hours I can already feel the excitement and the energy and the dynamism about the World Cup and we're still 10 years away uh so I can't imagine how you're feeling is the Minister of sport but take me back to the moment you heard you you'd won obviously you were the only bidder in the end yeah but that moment when you're awarded the World Cup must have been for you an extraordinary moment well thank you so much uh Piers for having me with you on the show and um you know welcome to Saudi Arabia I can't believe that it's your first time travel the whole world so but I think it's the right time to come and to talk about sports uh cuz you're a big fan of sports and and I think it's it's a good topic to talk about um yeah thank you for you know introduction and and you know looking forward 10 years from now it actually passes very quickly we still have a lot of work to do uh and preparation to to achieve what we want to achieve hopefully in the World Cup I think the first impression that we had was you know just um kind of a weight that was gone because a lot of people don't know that we've been started working on on on the bid and and wanting to host the World Cup see what are the issues are how can can we prepare for it and so on since 2018 so we really prepared uh very early on uh with an ambition that one day we would host the World Cup um and this comes all within the 2030 vision and his Royal Highness the crown princes Vision um and and hosting international events what can we do and so on and to develop Sports in the Kingdom uh so we've been working you know tirelessly for six years um monthly meetings with his Royal Highness about details and what could work what doesn't work and so on um and there wasn't even actually a bid regulation that came out so um we looked at the previous bed regulations what can we take from there what can we know in terms of the U specifications of the facilities um what goes in into preparation in terms of logistics uh Transportation um hotels healthc care everything that that that uh that comes into that um and I think uh also what made us you know very well prepared is that it was all planned within the 2030 Vision so everything that we're doing is part of the 2030 Vision whether we host the World Cup or not is is all projects that are um been uh submitted to the government and and planned to deliver on by 2030 so hopefully by 2030 all of you know the the the preparation would be done we'll have some some stadiums to finish later on after that um and then we looked at you know the the the capacity because it will be 48 countries um participating which is the most that any individual Nation 100% has ever hosted so America obviously has three countries hosting exact with Mexico and Canada and they have the same number which is the highest ever but you're the only country to take it on yourself that's a lot of country yes but Saudi is a big country as well Geographic geographically and it's a different you know um territories with different uh cultures and and and and so on so it's and it will be a nice diversity of for the fans to to to travel throughout the kingdom and I think for us that's what we want we want to welcome the world uh to come to Saudi we want to to show them what Saudi is and what better way to put it in in the big in the biggest event in the world which is the World Cup so that moment just you know you know when you work that long and then suddenly it nailed that you have it uh I don't think anyone can you know express what they really feel at the moment but it's it's uh a moment of Joy it's a moment of uh uh Pride that you know we represented uh the the nation in a in a good way and and the hopefully that we can deliver on hosting the best World Cup experience that you'll ever have how helpful is it to you that Qatar became the first Middle Eastern country to host a World Cup because I was there for a week week and I was very impressed I thought it was an excellent World Cup many people who went agreed with that including a lot of professional uh football legends I spoke to um and it kind of I guess showed you where the lines of attack are going to come about Sai Arabia you know what they are and we'll discuss those but Qatar went through all that as well um what did you think of the Qatar World Cup what lessons do you think you learned from that I think they did an amazing job uh I was there the whole time and and I think uh in terms of organization it was one of you know the best that you can you can achieve um and I think they had a really big opportunity that you can actually attend all the matches uh of the World Cup and I think deani Giani did that by going you know the first half to one match even I know people who walked exactly to all the stadiums yeah and and I don't think there were any issues in terms of you know hosting the the or they had for sure they they would have had some small issues in organization and so on but from what we've seen it was exceptional and you know we we we supported them with with uh with uh some of the knowhow that we have we've been there our fans were there uh so we learned a lot and and we work with them as we speak to to learn from their experience as well what worked what didn't work you know you can you can think of a lot of good ideas but will it work on the ground or not and but you can't compare um you know it was all hosted in in in in in a small territory uh but when you look at Saudi there's travel time there's uh there's uh a lot of logistics that come in a lot of different and the population is much bigger um there are 15 stadiums planned for the World Cup yes and my understanding is eight of them will be in Riad so in a sense Riad will be a kind of version of katar but it's the other seven venues so the first question fans will ask well how far do we have to travel what's the furthest distance how do you get there all that kind of the whole logistic system that we're working on we have international airports all over the country in the in the destinations that we'll have the the uh the the stadiums and where the the group stages are going to be held and all the matches um linked by uh Airlines buses and and some which will have train uh connectivity as well um so the the longest that you'll travel by plane would be 2 hours um and and we think that that's going to give you an a good uh time to travel between matches and so on uh but also uh 80 60% of the population around the world is only8 hours away from Saudi right so is that right yeah it's an amazing so that's an amazing number that you certainly very easy to get here from England I know that exactly and and I think the the nice thing about it is that you won't have any jet lags uh you know three hours ahead of the UK exactly eight hours ahead of America America that they may find they may find it a bit difficult but um but I think you know it's it's in terms of connectivity you'll have you know and and we've laid that out in our bid what what do we what do we plan on doing from now to uh to then to to connect all of these um uh cities together and to make sure that the Fan Experience is of the highest uh that they would enjoy and and entertain and and have the most memorable experience that they can well that brings me to the biggest question of all actually probably the second biggest we'll come to the biggest but for fans the big question will be when are you having this tournament because katar obviously waiting for a winter tournament that causes a lot of issues with some of the leagues Premier League in the UK didn't like it some of the European leagues didn't like it very disruptive to their normal domestic leagues um but in terms of the temperatures I was there for a week it was very pleasant a bit like it is here now like in the early' 70s 20 OD degrees centerr and so on um it's a big ongoing debate what are you going to do I mean have you made a decision yet about whether this is going to be in your summer where it could be 40° C or the winter well as I said you know Saudi is huge so even if you come to the in the summer in the South where one of the stadiums and some of the group stages are going to be there at the same temperature as we are today and it's much cooler uh than than where we are in real during the summer but that's a debate that we're still having with with um with FIFA and I'm sure that the ultimate goal would be what would be the best um experience for the fans uh uh to to come and attend but also you know we have a 10 months league as well that they play in different climates and and and so on so it's not an issue uh about the temperature that big of an issue I think we should put the right steps in into delivering the right necessary accommodation and services that are there um and and you know when we looked at what happened in in was it was a success even that it happened during the time that it happened um and everyone went on with their business and and it didn't affect anyone in a big way um and some actually claimed that the the matches were actually better at that time because it was like in the beginning of the Season uh and the athletes were at their uh performance instead of end of a season yeah the the the counterargument from the clubs of course is that the players come back exhausted yeah um and that they were moaning and whining about that we used it as an excuse at arsal my team but um but it's you know it's an interesting debate because I could imagine The Fan Experience which you talk about as wanting to be the the most important thing a lot of fans if they come and it's 40 degrees celsius walking around they will not be used to that and that brings with it actually you know probably legitimate health issues as well yeah and you know we're looking at what would be the best honestly I don't know uh I mean we still have a long way uh to to decide on that and a lot could change in the next 10 years even with leagues and and so on um but I think you know the experience that we have had in showcased that it can happen and and it can happen in a proper way and and nobody you know big time got affected with it um and you know they they still complain about the the athletes and and and how many matches they have during a normal season uh so that's why we're still debating this with with FIFA and I think it will be a joint decision to be to be taken by everyone and we want to share this with everyone to have the best experience for the number one Global event in the world which is the FIFA World Cup the the big question in katar particularly for English fans was well can we have a drink and they were going to be allowed one right to the point that the tournament began and then I think a day or two before suddenly it was announced no alcohol it was not complete ban you could go to some bars on the sticks a bit and get a drink Saudi obviously alcohol is illegal here like you say 10 years is a long time I mean given the rate of evolution in this country in the last 10 years I wouldn't I wouldn't say anything as a guarantee but as things stand is it likely that alcohol will be prohibited here during the World Cup well it is now so I can speak about now but I think that the the most important thing is how will it affect our our event and we don't see any effect I mean we've hosted more than 100 international events as we speak um everyone has come and enjoyed it and and and and it's become really a family environment of attending to these events that that you know that that people come and enjoy and and um I know that some fans would you know for them it's it's something that they look look up to and and and they want to and to be part of that and and to be part of their experience um but we don't see that it's it's an issue honestly um you know you've you mentioned and and and what happened a lot attended they enjoyed the matches uh I think the stats also reflect in a positive way that you know some of the chaos that happens around some some fans and and so well there was Zero arrest of English fans at a football tournament this is unprecedented I mean when you think of the terrible scenes that are Euros final uh the last one was just awful I was there absolutely horrendous and I I got to say the experience in cata was so much better just to be able to experience going very safely and no one getting drunk and fighting and misbehaving was was a nice change I think that will be the ultimate goal for everyone uh to have a good time to enjoy and and I don't think that will be an issue for us uh um you know in in the world cup so so I think you know we can we should focus on The Fan Experience more than anything else and we know that we can deliver on something Spectacular from what we hosted so far so it hasn't really been an issue for us there will be two groups of people that will be concerned about their safety here one is women a lot of women who maybe have never been to Saudi um who say well how safe am I going to be can I walk around around on my own do I have to have some form of male Guardian with me um you know will I be allowed to drive if I want all these sort of questions that you know you're going to be asked what's the answer what's your message to women from outside the region who come here for the World Cup well I think that you know women today in Saudi Arabia have you know the most rights that they've ever had and and the the reforms that have been done in the past uh uh 8 years more than 150 reforms uh they're more independent or they are independent they can actually open their own businesses they can have their own uh access to their own you know uh lives uh without any Guardians there're no more Guardian uh you don't need to have a male Guardian to walk around inside as a woman that has changed yeah um and that all people probably don't know that exactly and and we I see it sometimes in the media people still talk about that but that has changed they're more independent um you know we and Saudi is one of the safest countries in the world even with the with the numbers and the ranking within the uh G20 uh categorization and so on uh we guarantee everyone's safety it's something very important for us not just for women but for everyone uh within the kingdom and and we make sure that we we put the right regulations to make sure that everyone comes and enjoy nobody's going to ask you where you're going who you are what you're doing women drive here now yeah for sure yeah and any woman can get a license yes and and they can attend any event that they would like whether it was sporting or any other event they have independent lives today that they can U you know be more independent and and reflect on themselves and and you know um even even divorce they can ask for a divorce if they wanted really so yeah so uh they allowed to get one yes one thing yeah by law yeah so they can they can yeah so so a lot of I know that a lot don't know about what the reforms have that have happened but there is a lot lot of reforms that happened in the past 8 years uh thanks to the leadership and and his Royal Highness the conference um with the 23 Vision that that have you know fixed a lot of these things that that we see the strives today I was at the AL NASA match last night Christian Ronaldo OB his Club there so it's very famous around the world uh there were lots of women in the in the audience in the crowd there um that wouldn't have happened two years ago women weren't allowed into stadiums that's a big change yeah um I mean as you're still a young man in many ways but are you surprised yourself at the speed of change in the last 10 years I mean if you tried to have this interview 10 years ago these would be very different answers you'd be giving me yeah I don't understand why they weren't allowed uh is is the is the question um and I think you know um if you look at like Mecca the Hol site in in the Islamic World women and men are are doing the you know the pilgrimage and they're going going together so why is a football stadium not allowed to go there but these were the laws so they had to uh abide with them uh and I don't think that you know everyone understood or a lot of people did not understand why we had these laws and I think this is where the evolution of the of the 23 Vision came in and and and fixed these things um you know today the environment within the stadiums is is much bigger uh is is much more entertaining for families going in there um and and you know a a newly wed that decides their weekend to go and enjoy something on the weekend before the husband would would think twice whether to go to a football match or take his family out for dinner let's say or take them out and spend time with them because he couldn't say because he couldn't take them and that all changed in 2018 uh just before women were allowed to to uh to attend uh to to drive so you know we started with that process and um and it just happened overnight um now we see you the stadiums filled with with with families attending even with kids going last time yeah and and it's created a really so it's changed even society and the relationship between men and women and and attending these events and and so on and it made the environment in the stadiums much better because they can go as a family and enjoy a weekend watching Cristiano Ronaldo with their kids and and and have entertain a match and and then uh and then get on with their weekend so a lot of these changes you know I think there was always this question is why um and and we never understood it but when it Happ sounds like you were asking that question yourself I did yeah to myself and and when we discuss it we I don't I didn't understand why they weren't allowed to go to uh to to the stadiums and and you know it takes you know strong leadership to take such difficult questions within within society and that's the the representation of the leadership that we have today uh um and I think that it's because it's for a good cause and it works for the society it makes it better for the people um and that's why the decision was taken and no effects at all uh it just happened overnight so so we're very happy with that yeah I'll come to to women's sport because I know it's been very fast growing here yeah um the other sector of of community if you like globally that are concerned are the LGBT community um it's illegal to be gay here as it was in Kata in fact as it was for a quarter of all the countries that reached the last 32 in the World Cup finals in Qatar as I pointed out to people yeah it was illegal to be gay in England in 1966 when we won the World Cup last so um you know it's been an evolution for a lot of countries this issue but what do you say to gay people who may want there'll be a lot of gay football fans who want to come to the World Cup will they be welcome here everyone's welcome and and we've said that in the past and we've said that to all the events that we've hosted as I told you we have have more than 100 international events that we've that we've hosted and we haven't had any issues with anyone um from that Community everyone's welcome uh to come to Saudi nobody's going to ask you uh other than what the information in your passport is uh you have you know full privacy of your of your uh thoughts and and your uh beliefs and and so on and nobody will will will do that all that we ask is that we have our rules and regulations and our culture that we ask people to respect is the same as when we go anywhere else in the world we respect everything even if I don't believe in it or I don't um you know uh believe that that some of the rules and regulations abide by what I believe in but I respect it because I'm there and and I and I and I showcase should people be careful about if they're coming to Saudi Arabia if they're coming for six weeks to watch the whole world cup or how many weeks it'll end up being what should they just be careful about doing what would you advise them not to do well I think you know we have slightly you know we abide by the Islamic law and and Islamic tradition and and so on and you know but what you abide with I cannot enforce that on you and and that's what I abide with and and and so on so I think that they shouldn't be really careful of a lot of things it's just that they should abide by the regulations that are there I'm sure they know a lot of it that are that are there and and just enjoy the event for the event and keep it sporting and and enjoy sports as it is um you know I think that a lot try to hijack Sports in in in a lot of ways for political reasons or and and and we don't mix that at all even with our political stands towards uh with our sporting stands towards certain uh certain things you know we've had issues with other neighboring countries uh that we didn't have any relationship with them but they compete they come because we believe that Sports has nothing to do with sport you did in recent times with katar of course 100% yeah Saudi had major problems with there you were as it turned out beating the eventual world champions in cat amaz probably the greatest moment in the history of Saudi sport actually um so that shows you that an example of what you're talking about 100% And as I said you know we we've been successful in hosting more than a 100 international events that hosted people from all over the world more than 160 countries and nationalities and and so on and everyone has come everyone has had fun all colors alled all sexuality yes and and no one has any issues um all what you ask is respect our culture and what goes with it that's it the big issue that katar had was that in the construction of all their stadiums a lot of Migrant workers died I spoke to some of their leaders at the time and they conceded it was you know it was wrong that too many migrant workers were dying in the process of building those those big stadia you have more stadia you're building here because you got more teams playing obviously and you've got a lot of Migrant workers here from all over the world from Neal to Bangladesh to wherever and they come here in big numbers um I would imagine that you've looked at what happened in Katan you want to avoid the same criticism coming your way you've already been getting a bit of it human rights groups have been uh putting out reports that say that a lot of Migrant workers have been killed already what is your response to that well it is a serious um issue and and we have we have looked at it and you know for us I think just hosting the World Cup one of the reasons is to show us you know what the issues are because you know sometimes you can go on by developing a nation and not realizing what the issues are and and I think these are things that we take very seriously and I think to pinpoint that uh specifically is that a lot of the reforms that happened in the past 8 years uh are are our workers reforms that that are abide by law to to to make sure that we have the right system that everyone is safe and everyone has their rights within the kingdom living in the Kingdom you mentioned we have a lot of workers 40% of our population is experts um so that's a big population we want them to live a healthy um and prosperous lifestyle within the kingdom uh so we put a lot of reforms towards the the workers uh program that we've had we're part of the ILO which is the international labor organization which the UK Japan also are part of of that and we abide by the regulations that are there uh we work closely with them uh I think there's a lot of improvement that needs to be done and we are looking at it in a in a in a in a serious uh Manner and we are taking the right steps towards uh towards that today uh all the com we have around 660,000 entities that have to register all of all of their contracts to the uh Ministry of Labor uh and we monitor which is around 9 million contracts that we monitor we can audit we can make sure that they get their pay we can make sure that they they're they're being taken care of also that we make sure that there is a connection that we can hear from them what their complaints are what that they can complain about other things that are that are there and when you look at the numbers you know I hear I I hear and and and read some of these articles but when you look at the numbers the percentage of death in in and the labor force is is 1.1% to every 100,000 so we are one of the lowest countries in the world in that percentage um needless to say we are looking at it in a in a serious way we are putting the right measures to to make sure that we don't fall into this issue in in the future especially as you mentioned with a lot of these development and and going on not just in sports but also in other GGA projects that we're working on I mean if you look at project we had 50 million hours of no fatalities with the project so for those who don't know about that project yeah it's it's a it's a it's a UNESCO heritage site that that is um within uh close to Rial but it's actually the first capital of the Saudi State uh it was demolished during the Ottoman Empire and that's why the Saudi State moved to to RI uh but now it's a UNESCO site and there's a full residential sporting entertainment uh development that's happening uh there so hopefully when you come for the for the world cup you'll get to enjoy the the the facilities and the services that they provide uh over there so that's one of the Giga projects that we have another one is Gia as well I think 20 million hours without any fatalities that are that are happening so but it's obviously something you're you're concerned about yes yes we're aware of it and we're looking into it and for sure there's a lot of you know there's room to improve but we want to work with the with the ILO and with all the entities and with all the the right people to make sure that we that we put the right steps to because you know welfare and and health being for uh our workers and everyone working inide is very important to us what do you say to those who go all you're doing is sports washing this is all about sort of airbrushing the human rights issues that Saudi has same criticism was leveled at katar of course that it's about sports watching I watched the crown Prince's interview with Brett Bear at Fox News and he was very like Direct he was very like people want to say that fine I don't care um but then he outlined what he believed it was about which was that actually self-evidently the oil is running out that has been what your big Revenue earn has been of course for a long time it is running out and you have to replace that Revenue somehow and you've identified sport tourism and entertainment as the best way potentially to replace the dwindling oil revenues so that's the argument that comes from people in Saudi but what do you say to those outside who say I come off it this is all about sports watching well I mean as as his Royal Highness the conference mentioned in that interview is that that what is the reflection of Hosting these events uh in the Kingdom you know we talk about in 2017 we had 32 federations today we have 97 federations we talk about women's sports the possibility to to host women uh events you know we just hosted WTA uh a month ago or just more than a month ago and and the experience that the players came uh with we had the same allegations before they come and when they came and you saw that what what they talked about when they when they were here but today we have 50,000 uh tennis players in schools I thought very significant to Billy Jean King who's be one of the great spokeswomen for tennis and for the LGBT community in in World sport that she came out and was pretty supportive I I was surprised and then thought that was a very significant moment actually there was a moment of people kind of drawing a bit of a Line in the Sand and saying actually we want to be part of this now saud's investing billions and billions into Sport and we think that's a better thing than the critics would suggest 100% because they can see what how it benefits the sport directly but also how does it benefit the people living in Saudi Arabia and in a positive way and I don't think anyone around the world doesn't want benefit for for anyone to try to try to come in and to to to see what we can uh develop from that I think you know just as I mentioned you know we have 50,000 students uh playing tennis today in schools that didn't happen a year ago um because of Hosting these events uh and because of these stars coming and they can you know aspire to be like these stars and so on to uh to to have opportunities to to to get there so so that's the real impact that we see you know you're a big fan of of boxing and you attended in Los Angeles the boxing match and so on um what I loved about it I have to be honest I mean it was a big boxing event in La last summer it was the re season it was called um but in the middle of it I wasn't I didn't know this were going to happen up popped Eminem to do a half hour concert and I was like this is great um and I do like the way that you guys are trying to combine the two things Sport and entertainment it's you know you see it a bit like at the Super Bowl in America um but you don't see it a lot actually I mean in English football for example you you don't get any entertainment to interfere with the football sometimes watching my team I wish we did um but is that a deliberate strategy to try and marry the two things yeah I mean it's it's all part of the 2030 Vision within the quality of life program within the 2030 Vision where we're all in that program to make sure that all the events that we have are connected together um to deliver the optimal experience that you can have um but also to enhance the the the the the entertainment uh you know at the end of the day it's all entertainment course um and and and to deliver on on the best and and the standard that we have from the Crown Prince is always deliver on the best I don't want any half jobs being done he wants the best to be done in the right way and do you accept that an element of sportswashing is inevitable whether it's intended or not in the sense that obviously if you put on great sporting events great entertainment events and all these things that inevitably it's going to give a bit of a halo effect to any country it does it I mean look I remember the London Olympics in 2012 I remember how it made us all feel in London it made us feel great and it put a great halo over the city over the country the queen was leading it you know it was James Bond was involved um and it felt great I got to say it disappeared pretty quickly after was that feeling so you be careful um but you know in a way every country that puts on these events you of course you're trying to show off your country at its best so do you do you just accept that as part of it inevitably you're going to get that yeah for sure I mean like you know as you mentioned anywhere of the world you go to you get that experience and that feeling that that that happens but also I think it's it's also that we're trying to invite the world to come and see Saudi Arabia um and I think these events attract people to come and and you know there's a perception about Saudi and you hear a lot in the media about Saudi I think 100% I've never met anyone that did not come to Saudi in the past 8 years and did not change or spoke positively in a way what to you most annoying misconceptions as you would see it about this country that all of these reforms did not you know when they talk about the women's guardianship when they talk about the cfala system with for the workers that was that was all lifted it was all gone it's no longer there and I can't believe people still talk about it it's been gone for years um and I was interesting for example that for this interview I never having been to Saudi I thought well they're probably going to have a lot of restrictions they're going to tell me you can't talk about this can't talk about that nothing and I'm saying that you know for the record because I think it's significant you haven't told me I can't ask you anything right um you haven't any restrictions in fact you didn't want me to have any restrictions I think I mean that a lot of people think that Saudi suppresses free speech and I think there's Merit to that argument in many ways uh as a journalist certainly I wouldn't have the same Freedom as a journalist here that I do back home but certainly in terms of our interactions you've made no effort to send me I mean you couldn't cuz the show's called un sensive um but I was I was struck by that no but but that's who we are and and you know there as I said there is a perception about Saudi and a lot of people talk about Saudi and they've never been to Saudi which also you know is mind-blowing to me as well you know how can you talk about somewhere or anyone that you never met you've never talked to you don't you've never been to so Kat heard the same thing exactly I just knew the ones that were fact they said the most criticism came from the UK and UK journalists and it was interesting to me I did wonder have you any of you been there actually actually physically got on a plane and gone there to experience it because the experience the people had at the World Cup didn't bear much relation to what was being written about back home I didn't feel yeah but they're all welcome to come to Saudi who's never been to to Saudi and that's a discussion that I have with everyone that you know has any concerns with Saudi there's a lot that they talk about in the media and so on but come see for yourself and then judge and that will be very fair to me uh but don't judge us and you don't know us uh and and you've never been to Saudi if you were criticizing Saudi Arabia if you were a journalist from the outside I know it's not something you aspire to be but if you were what what do you still need to do what do you need still need you think to work on to improve as part of this very fast moving Evolution that's going on and I'm going to come to your own experience of that because you've seen it at firsthand having lived here for 40 odd years is but when you look at Saudi Arabia now where do you want it to get to quite quickly what do you think are still the things that are a problem I think we should be more outspoken about who we are I think we should be more um connected um to the world you know um and and to be present and I think we're doing that but not as to the same Pace as we're doing compared to a lot of things that we're we're we're getting maybe because it's in our culture that we're a bit shy uh and and and and you know we we need a bit of time to get to break the ice as they say um but once that is is done then you know everything is is open and I think the hospitality that the Saudi people have is strikes a lot of people when they first come here um you know you hear a lot of crazy stories about you know certain things that happened during the the the events you know just last week we had the D and it give you just a small glimpse to that and and and one of the competitors on a motorbike dropped his phone in the desert and a guy found his phone and he actually followed the whole uh race for like two days Days yeah two days to find the person really yeah and and he he found he found who who he was so he connected to his wife through Instagram who was in Australia and she told them that this is the number because he had to come up he had to issue a new SIM card because his phone is not with him and and and he actually reports it and and you can see it on his social media that he's been following oh we came to this area and we didn't find him we need to look for him uh but in the end he delivered the phone to him uh and to make sure that it was his phone he asked him to put the passcode and he put it in so um but it that was genuine that was completely out you know that he wanted to do that uh uh the the Saudi guy that I mean I found since I've been here not very long I'm saying for the week but people have been very welome in very hospitable and whether that's people that I would expect to be because I'm their guest but also just the public as I've been walking around going to shops and talking to people um what I don't know is what happens when you get away from the glitz and glamour of the festar hotels and you know me coming here but you should go yeah you should maybe I should yeah you should come for a holiday and just experience the people because I think it's our biggest asset it's the people it's the population it's how friendly and how hospitable they are and young exactly 70% of Saudis are under 35 it's an amazing statistic only 4% of your population is over 65 I think which is extraordinary yeah we have a very young population and and we need to get them busy with good stuff and and for the future healthwise and and also uh to get them you know to have a strong and prosperous Society for for the future um and do people get free healthcare here yes yeah and education and education is free you can you can have private as well if you want to you can have private yes but there's free for but there's free for everyone essentially the same kind of system as the UK yes for health and education yes and and you can have private of course um but but there is health care for for everyone and and and and also you know I think it's it's that's the dynamic movement that you see that is happening and I think everyone Embraces this um Evolution with the 2030 Vision that it's it's and that's what made also a lot of things move very quickly is that it's that young uh population you have a young leader you have a young pop understands what they want yeah and but you have and he also has a young population yes and so there's a kind of relationship and but also everyone's connected today through social media they see uh all of these events sporting events and they see what's happening around the world and they want it here you know I'm sure that a lot of Saudis went to to attend the World Cup where they never had the chance to travel to go to other places in the world just because it's next door uh they can drive there that they then they went there and imagine of that opportunity what will happen to the Saudis that who can't travel who can't go to these to these place and bringing these these these events to them but also when they see it on the ground it it the the the effect of change that happens within them and the demand that comes very quickly after that sometimes we have to catch up on what they want uh in terms of facilities and in terms of setting the right programs and you know I remember I was just mentioning before you attended the boxing in Los Angeles and just to reflect to that and a very simple note is that when we had our first boxing event in 2018 um it was I think Joshua Ruiz uh fight and um we had six gyms in Saudi that had boxing I know that boxing is big in the in the US and a lot of places but in Saudi it wasn't a big sport um and it was kind of a new sport to us um now I'm sure there's more than 100 gyms that that have uh that have boxing into them we've hosted after that look how many boxing event we've even sponsored boxing event uh abroad um but the number that struck me the most was the increase in participation by 300% in that sport um and that's the effect and that's the are you seeing the same with tennis and golf with all sports um you know we're talking about Golf and and to see the the effect of of of what's happening in golf and and you know I remember the the golf course that we have here in RI hardly anyone talks about now it's fully booked and and you can't go uh I think there's a waiting time for for a month to to to get a time I'm a big go I'm a big golf fan uh I'm I'm going to say I'm a little sad about the standoff between live golf and the PGA I want it resolved I think all golf fans want to see the best players back regularly competing against each other it just doesn't work having them all split most of the time do what do you feel about that I totally agree and I think that you know for the sake of the sport I think you know nobody wants any issues within any sports or organizations and and I think and I'm sure they will they will eventually come to to an agreement to to reach to something that will that will prosperous the the sport of golf I think that's the benefit that that everyone should look for um and how do you develop the sport in a new way or how do you come with new ideas and how do you go to new territories to to spread uh the these events and and is there a lot of hypocrisy if you're honest like take the gulf you know I found that some of the PGA side when they put the old moral Halo on and I'm like well hang on you do play in China right I I don't see you crying about oppression of weer Muslims for example you seem quite happy to associate yourselves with China and yet you're making a big fuss about the morality of live Gulf because they're in bed with the Saudis do you think it's hypocritical in a way yes um and I think you know a lot of people don't criticize themselves to see what the uh what the uh what the issue is they just criticize what they don't like and then they realize that they're doing the same thing um but I think that a lot of matured in in in the past years towards that actually no is it benefiting the sport uh then that's what we should be looking at and I think there is where we should focus on you know today with whoever comes in um investing or or developing different sports is it is it benefiting the sport are this is this sport going to grow is it going to attract more uh uh players is it going to attract more athletes to come in is it going to go to more territories around the world then that's what we should be focusing on um to to develop this because any growth is good for anyone for everyone football is obviously getting bigger and bigger here in Saudi Arabia I feel partly responsible feel like you should be thanking me really because without my interview with Cristiano Ronaldo that led to him leaving Manchester United he wouldn't be here leading the revolution uh but I know I spoke to him briefly last night but I know that he uh since he's coming he's l he's loved the experience um his family have loved it he's enjoyed building a brand new not a brand new league but certainly taking it to a brand new level uh he now believes it's the fourth best league in the world certainly comparative to to say the French league yeah some agree some don't agree but certainly the rate of change and Improvement has been extraordinary here how big a deal obviously in terms of money it was a very big deal Ronaldo became the highest paid athlete in the world with that deal but how big a deal was it to get someone of his stature to come and lead the revolution in Saudi for football well thank you for doing that interview and helps with that so no but I think you know he's an exceptional athlete and and he's an exceptional role model uh to everyone around the world and you see that and we saw that the first day he came the impact that we have if in you know just being visible just being in the world's eye that you're there uh and and how do we need to deliver on that so a lot of progressed with him in a lot of ways and I remember that we discussed a lot uh regarding how do we uplift uh the league how do we uplift the the club uh that he plays with facility wise all of these things you know he's he's part of our contribution for the for the 2034 ambassador to uh to the 2034 uh World Cup so as an athlete to to have someone that has lived through it all and has won everything in it is is a unique situation you know what's amazing I watched him last night I said to him I want you to score a hattick and then dedicated it to me and he scored one and had two disallowed I was like we were so close I'm sure he'll be and the last one was unbelievably great goal he was but he was F fuming raging about the last goal because he knew it was a good goal he knew it would be doing the rounds on social media and you know fueling yet again the myth of Cristiano and to see him so angry at the end was just extraordinary you think this guy's 40 next month he's got nothing left to prove he's broken almost every record in football and yet it still matters to him but that's what makes him who he is and that's what makes him achieve all of this I think that fire and that desire from within to always keep on growing and delivering and being there and I think that's the best role model that you can have for the Youth um that even that you've won it all he has won everything and and and he doesn't need to prove anything to anyone but he still has that fire within him to to to move on and and and to develop and and to keep on on giving and I think that's the best example that you can have for an athlete um you know and that's what we want from our athletes to see and we see it on the ground you know talking about the league as soon as we signed with him suddenly other players wanted to come then they started to come Neymar Bena all of the other the other players that started want to come but also the exposure that we have of the 106 more than 60 uh Nations around the world are broadcasting the Saudi league today uh the increase of Revenue compared to how many before Christiano okay I think 10 really yeah so that's the difference when I notic that Al NASA Instagram account has 17 million followers exactly I think before he came it was like 2 million I think less that so all the metrics go through the roof and t-shirts yeah you find your t-shirts around the world and and and and so on so people you know you're in you or you you're there in in the sporting world that you're a spotlight today uh and that put a lot of responsibility on us to deliver on what people want as well is the strategy still to get these bigname Marquee signings because one of the criticisms is that a lot of them are slightly older and that you've not been getting enough of the younger upand coming Stars so until you do that you can't really compete with the the best leag I think you accept that that was some of the claims that were that were happen but when you see some of the signings that the clubs have done in the past year especially in the summer you know most of them have been younger or 23 or or or younger than that you know our ambition with the league and that's what we're working with them so hard is that to have it because we believe in the sport and we believe in developing football and we believe that we should have a strong League like anywhere else in uh in the world and we we think that we have the capabilities to do that and the reason to do it which is the people you know um the fans are are really big fans of football and and that creates that economy or that commercialization that that develops from it so you need you have fans that attend the matches and then you have also the the private sector coming in and and creating that economy that can be sustainable for the future and I think that's what we're we're looking mostly at these players of course bring they put the spotlight you know but but also a shortcuts a lot of things that we could have done in five years we did it in one year um you know enhancing you know one of the benefits that I had was Steven Gerard coming to to to toag and I remember speaking to him and he was complaining about certain facilities and things that he needed requirements from the from the club and I told him listen to send me what is a standard cuz we don't know you come from the Premier League you know what the standard is you know what what this clubs uh what you need as as a professional coach to to uh to to deliver on so literally he gave us a standard of what needs to be developed uh in terms of infrastructure in terms of uh what is the system that needs to be done within a club and so on and we've cascaded that on all the other clubs as well and did he have a thing at the end that said and I also want you to sign Mo Salah my old team Liverpool all clubs do that all coaches want that is he the biggest trophy right now because he's the most high-profile Muslim player in the world he's arguably the one of the best two or three players in the world world he hasn't signed a new contract yet is he is he the big prize well definitely because if he takes all the all the right boxes even for us would love to have him he's you know he's Egyptian and we have a very good relationship and we feel like we're one with the Egyptians as well from our culture and our uh you know history and so on uh so to have moah or or other players that are good Role Models would be you know a pleasure and a privilege to have in the Saudi League will it happen or not that's up to the clubs to decide and and to see what negotiations go on but I think that you know in the end of the day that you know coming back to the league is that we want the league to be within the top five uh watched and commercially driven leagues and and and strong leagues that people around the world aspire to want to play there uh in in the Saudi league and and I don't see that there is any harm with that and and we we can collaborate with everyone you know in in Europe to make sure that we can deliver on that with the world bid one of the controversial aspects of it was that there were no other serious biders that came forward and in the end nobody bid against you so you had a free run now the FIFA uh evaluation report gave you a record high 4.2 out of five you had the backing of 120 of FIFA's 21 members and yet some have said there was a lack of transparency that this all seemed to happen very quickly how come Saudi just got away with this is what they're saying what do you said of that well as I mentioned before I think a lot of people don't know that we've been working on it for us doing our homework you know and and as you know as as a lot of athletes they don't just show up on the race day and and decide to perform and they do they have to put a lot of performance and a lot of hard work before that to be ready on race day to deliver and I think we you know about race days cuz you used to drive professional that's one of the one of that's one of theing the lon 24hour right yes and and I had we're going to come to your sure craving for spee in the moment but I learned you know that from racing you know you can't just show up on a weekend and expect to deliver when you haven't put the time in uh in the and because there's someone else putting it and and being ready and I think that you know we came we came really well prepared we abide by the FIFA regulations everything was transparent everything was clear um we had the support we lobed properly with with a lot of the um uh countries uh to support our bid uh and I think that's what sealed the deal that we just came well prepared there were restrictions I mean people probably don't know this a lot of people that under the rotation policy uh only bids from Asia and Oceana were considered for 203 so that massively reduced the number of countries that could host it anyway and countries like Australia were looking at it but then didn't in the end would it have helped you if somebody else had bid in the end do you think terms it helped us in a way in term of the court of public opinion the fact that nobody B it looked like well what have the Saudi done here you know and the answer may be of course absolutely nothing but the impression was you must have done something to scare everybody off we we talk to everyone and we explain to everyone that we want to bid and we talked to all the federations we talked to uh and and we prepared to it and I think that's why nobody came in is because they saw how well prepared we were um and I I tell you we reviewed the US bid we reviewed the bid we reviewed all of these things what are the issues we didn't know because at the time what the bid regulations are FIFA hasn't announced it yet but we wanted to be prepared at least they're going to go within you know they're going to move left or right but within this uh parameter that that is there so we reviewed everything for six years that we prepared this file um and I think we just came well prepared and everyone knew that from the federations that we were there and as I said it was very transparent it was very clear um FIFA was very clear about it not just for 34 but also for 30 um and as you mentioned maybe because of the cycle was for Asian ocean to be to be the only candidate that could be at the time is helped yes it did uh that we don't go into any um bidding war with anyone else um and and but in the end you have a really strong bid for 30 which will go to um Portugal uh Spain Morocco and South America um and it will you know highlight celebrating 100 years for FIFA as well uh which I think it will be an amazing experience between these three different uh uh destination or continents uh before that you have the US of course with the territory and and going to the US and seeing how large the US is and and knowing you think journalists are going to give the same scrutiny to US Canada and Mexico and their human rights records as you're going to get uh no but it is what it is that's interesting yeah but it is many would say if you look at Mexico you look at a lot of America's foreign policy in the last 50 years a lot of legitimate questions to be raised there yeah but I suspect we're not going to get the same negativity that's not going to stop us from from doing what's right and what we think is right for us um and I think everyone has the right to do that um and I think we're doing it in a way that we're open to the world and asking everyone to share this journey with us um things change very quickly and some things won't it will take time uh to change uh but just give us the time to to evolve and develop uh towards that FIFA said that stag in the tournament in the Kingdom represented a medium human rights risk it claimed it had a good potential to act as a catalyst for reformers which we know are ongoing uh the Saud bid had a good overall commitment to sustainability and was deemed low risk when it came to Environmental Protection so that was all quite positive Amnesty International condemned the decision to uh have the World Cup here in Saudi is should joint statement on behalf of 21 separate organization said FIFA's Reckless decision to award the World Cup to Saudi Arabia without ensuring adequate human rights Protections in place will put many lives at risk that was their head of Labor rights and sports Steve Coburn uh and they said based on clear evidence to dat FIFA knows workers will be exploited and even die without fundamental reforms in Saudi Arabia and yet has chosen to press ahead regardless we talked about the the migrant worker issue but just on the issue of Human Rights and what amnest inter AAL say you know a lot of people will think am International is a very respected organization and if they say that there are proper causes for concern what do you say to people well I say that no one's perfect everyone's developing everyone's working towards a better future for their nation and a lot of these issues that we face today a lot of Nations have been through You' mentioned some of them and how things have have have developed towards that and and we are doing what we think is right for us and and for the people in the kingdom and what we think will will develop to to a better future for everyone in the Kingdom but also in the region um and I think that you know a lot of people talk about Saudi uh and have claims about Saudi but they've never been here they've never seen what the reality is a lot of these claims when you really dig deep into the cause of it you'd find in the end that someone broke the law in the end to to uh to to to face any of these uh issues that come that arise but the story is not told and full towards that we have you know a a a legal system or judicial system that is completely independent that is monitored by the Human Rights Watch in Saudi um everyone has a right to defend themselves and so on in in legal cases and so on um and and we we take these things very seriously to evolve in the right way um you know we talked about the workers and and so on and we are evolving we are developing we are moving forward towards that some things as you mentioned you know will move very very quickly and and and so on some will take time for you know our culture and our things to change but we're just asking that you know respect us for who we are and and believe in what we're doing because we've showcased that uh in the past with these with these reforms that that are happening within the kingdom and we've delivered on it uh and we will continue to work with the right organizations like the ILO and and FIFA to make sure that we deliver on our role towards uh these accusations that are happening there there have been calls for countries like Russia to be banned from the World Cup indefinitely at the moment people are saying if it came to it would you be happy for Russia as things stand to compete in 2034 I mean that decision is with FIFA it's not with with us but we have no we don't mix politics with with sports at all uh you know I've mentioned that some of the countries that that we we host their clubs and and some of their athletes that come to to Saudi we don't have any relation any political relationship with them but they still come and and they still you know attend the events and and and and so on so we don't politicize or or C when you see the controversy over the cricket for example with Afghanistan yeah who have a men's team but they the Taliban have banned all women from competing in sports so there's no women's team yeah which breaches it would seem the international the ICC the the governing body of cricket it breaches their rule that you must feel male and female team England are due to play them uh very soon actually lot of pressure building that maybe England should refuse to play uh even though the Afghan men's team is not based in Afghanistan it's based outside that the principle should be if the Taliban are going to stop women competing in sport then we shouldn't be encouraging playing them in the men's game what do you think I think the athlete shouldn't be a victim of political decisions I think every athlete that wants to compete in any that's my personal view to be honest and you know a lot of sanctions happen in in the Sports World and so on but in the end of the day the uh the for political reasons and at the end of the day the victims are the athlete nothing changed politically but who did not who missed an opportunity to go to a big tournament or an International Event and and or Olympics or the World Cup because of a political decision uh where they've lived their whole life to deliver on this opportunity that they that they have and he has no change in it he he can't change that so the athletes won't be able to change that um so they shouldn't be used in a way for to be politicized in a way that's what I personally think you know and and and and I think you know not mixing politics with sports just leaves Sports As Natural as it is and and welcoming to everyone and and giving the opportunity to everyone to compete in sports that should be the the ideal I think uh Way Forward for these International would you be comfortable if Israel compete here they do they do already yeah they do and that's been ongoing since the war in Gaza yeah yeah yeah they do we have some Israeli athletes that come for some of the international events that that we have um we have no issue with them coming and competing that's what I'm saying that we don't mix some of our athletes play against the Israeli uh teams in in uh in uh in international events um and that's not uh a iCal decision at all it's a sporting uh decision that's how we look we we stand firmly with the Palestinian people and we've been speaking politically uh the government has been speaking politically in support of the Palestinian people and doing everything for the Palestinian people and we condemn the war in in in in in in Palestine and Israel but that has nothing to do with the sporting events Donald Trump is the president of the United States again he's a massive sports fan loves his boxing loves his golf nearly lost his life on a golf course last summer um you know is this a good thing do you think he obviously he likes Saudi Arabia has a good relationship with the Crown Prince he's already said that it might be one of the first trips he makes is this a good thing that he's been reelected for you guys if he love sports yes but that's what I can talk about um no as you mentioned he's he's a big sports fan he believes in it and I think that um the relationship between Saudi and and the US has been ongoing for uh a a lot of years and and I think it's deeply rooted um that we're you know we're allies in in a lot of things uh but we work very closely with sports institutions uh within the the US Olympic Committee in in the US and and a lot of our students are actually studying in the US they they and and we have programs with certain universities for our athletes uh for scholarship programs and and and and so on so so I think you know having a leader that understands sport um and the importance of sports and and and you can speak to him freely about that I think is is a benefit for everyone and in the World of Sports I would say you're Sports mad yourself and you were like I said earlier you you were a professional racing driver very successful you won a lot of races you competed in some big events to Lon 24 and others what did that teach you about yourself about leadership you know when you're in Elite Sport at the highest level to be a sports Minister now having done that that's going been an advantage well it it taught me a lot I'll be honest and and I think there that's why I think Sports is very important not only that you're it's nice it's entertaining and so on but when you do it on a you know on a top level it doesn't become anymore that joyful sometimes you you feel very uh stressed and and under a lot of pressure and no days off and and and missing a lot of holidays and and and and and things that you you'd wish to go to but then it it teaches you you know uh discipline it teaches you um respect um and it teaches you that it's okay to fail and and to grow up and and to to learn from it and move on um I think what it benefited me most in today in what we're doing today is that the long hours that we spend in the office um sometimes days uh without with very short sleep from you know my my previous uh career in in in motor sport is that I used do endurance racing so we used to spend you know the lar 24 hours NE green 24 hours Dubai 24 hours all of these long races and sometimes you always St for one hour during the 24 hours and you have to be ready to perform and and and comp practice for this exactly yeah so so so a lot of that is is uh is is is reflected in my daily life but also setting a program for yourself and being disciplined to that program because you know what the outcome is uh and I learned the the hard way I wasn't very disciplined when I started um and I I think I was just quick by talent but then when I when I reached to a certain level I didn't evolve I didn't grow um and I realized that I was missing something um and and I remember my first race that I did my first 24 hours race in a proper uh GT3 class which was the highest in in the Dubai 24 hours race is that we uh I did a couple of SC and I went out and I was completely destroyed I couldn't perform anymore anymore uh because it was the longest race and I was just physically not ready um then I realized that you actually have to do a lot of cardio a lot of the get the exactly and which I didn't do before Christiana could have told you that exactly but I didn't know the knoow I didn't have the knoow at the time as I said that you know Sports were was freshly developed in in the kingdom and and very um you know some sports didn't have any representation at the time and we're talking about 2005 2006 um so it's not been a long time ago but I think that's what you know Sports gives you the drive to keep on trying to keep on going and it keeps that in you uh that fire that you that you want and and and looking for other ways to to to win um and and finding other options and other solutions to do so so so I I really think that it represents a lot you know I think maybe 80 or 6 60 to 80% of who I am today is is because of the the history that that I went through um but I also started very late I started when I was 21 um imagine if I started when I was 4 years old um so that's what we're trying to do you could have been Louis Hamilton maybe really maybe if I had the opportunity but that's what we want to what what that's interesting about opportunity isn't it because it seems to me from everything I've gleaned since I've been here and in prepping to come here there's much more opportunity now for young Saudis to perhaps do what you wish you'd done start all this stuff a lot it because now they can become a racing driver they can become a tennis player there's one amazing story about two young orphan girls who because of the previous rules laws about women having to have a guardian they didn't have a guardian because they were orphans so they couldn't do anything and now the rule changed and now they're playing in the national women's football team yeah that's an amazing story a lot of people think well of course they should but actually it's an illustration of how fast things have changed that's what I'm trying to to to reflect on and is that the a lot of you know the opportunities that I did not have you know sitting here speaking to you that I want my kids to have uh and and and the younger generation to have that they can they can just live a normal life that we we consider and and have normal opportunities to to to grow in different things you you mentioned the the two orphans that we that we have and and they play in the national team and they scored actually the first ever goal for Saudi Arabia in a uh a a proper sanctioned match by FIFA and so on and now they're in the FIFA uh ranking for the first time we have you know a Saudi League uh that that's broadcasted on on FIFA plus uh uh throughout the world um that wasn't available two years ago three years ago uh imagine that opportunity that for these two girls that needed a guardianship but because they were open they didn't have a guardianship so they had nothing to do or they couldn't do anything you you have two children yes I think a son and a daughter um you you've been through an extraordinary period yourself in the life of Saudi Arabia where ironically you probably had it toughest right your parents probably had it a bit easier you had the hard yards and then your kids are going to have a very different experience yeah we we've gone through a lot of you know social movement I would say um you know things a lot of things were Ed in the past and then they were not allowed such as Cinemas and and so right so tell me that because that's an interesting so you know just to reflect a bit you know people think that you know don't can't relate to what with what I'm talking about is that you know my my mother and father grew up in in mud houses uh and and today you have skyscrapers and they're still alive they saw that uh his his majesty the custodian of the two holy mosque who's been the governor of Rial for over 50 50 years he saw the city of Rial move from mud houses to skyscrapers uh that's one generation uh of development and so on so life has really changed so so much from you know going through that we had the normal thing such as Cinemas and and you know you had this someone who who was going around the houses and and with with an old uh Cinema projector and and they would book him per day to to watch and gather and and watch uh movies uh to having it forbidden and then having it back again and you were in The Forbidden and I was in The Forbidden stage so imagine you're you're living in in but isn't that isn't that surreal isn't it that your parents had a more free existence than you did and now your kids will have the most free experience of all and that's all happened in the space of how old do you have you don't mind me asking 41 41 that's all happened in the space of under 50 years yeah this extraordinary Ro extraordinary yeah Evolution I would say uh and and different phases that that we've been through and that's why I think that we we we know what what what benefits us the most uh and and we listen and we hear and we're close to to to the to the to the requirements of what people want on on the ground um and I think that's why a lot of this change also happened very quickly without any issues is people accept it and people want it to to happen uh and it takes a strong leadership to take these decisions uh to to make that change in in in society towards the best uh for the future and some decisions you have to take them today uh that will feel the effects in in in a couple of years uh coming but coming to the opportunities is that you know I think the the the thing is that my son will not know the life that I lived and didn't didn't have these these opportunities or my son and daughter and and giving them these opportunities will let them start in an earlier age uh be brighter for the future hopefully and and put the right steps for them to grow stronger for the future and I think that's the opportunity that we are delivering today on the ground around through Sports through entertainment through culture through a lot of the social change that is happening but also through business and and reforming our our economy and diversifying our economy uh for the future and being more sustainable and being more present in the future I'm somebody who likes monarchies I love the British Monarchy obviously very very close relationship between the British Monarchy and the monarchy here yes um what's your thought about monarchy that idea of it are you a fan of the idea of a monarchy I am you're a member of it I'm probably not speaking to the most impartial Observer but do you think it's a sustainable model going forward say 100 200 years I think so I think you can see the benefits you can see the decisions that are taking place you can see the right decisions are are in place um it works maybe differently from country to Country and here we're very connected to the people we're we're part of the people we go to the same schools we go to the same uh there's no isolation or differences between between the monarchy here and and and so on so we we know the needs of the of the of of of what goes on on on the ground and I think that helps a lot in decision making um but also we come from a tribal uh you know um I would say history throughout the the Arab uh world but especially in the Arabian Peninsula is is this tribal Unity that is there um between the different tribes and the different families uh that's keeping or that's evolving in in the way that evolved uh you know to unify Saudi Arabia King abdulaziz to unify the founder of Saudi Arabia to unify Saudi Arabia 90 years ago or more uh you know riding a horse uh from one area to another there weren't any planes there weren't any you know cars or anything like that he couldn't have done it alone he's done it with with a lot of people and and and he used the right tools and the right leadership to Showcase that he can be the leader of of Saudi Arabia and and people wanted him to be uh and I think that's a burden on us as a royal family to always deliver on what the people want but I think also you know it takes um uh you in the end a good leader is a good leader uh and I we very wherever you are on the wherever you are I think whatever you do exactly I think we're very fortunate to have you know the leadership of the custodian of the two holy mosque King um and and his Royal Highness and we're very fortunate to his enthusiasm his passion and his uh uh um work ethics that that have been implemented in the past 8 years uh that we see on the ground today you know I remember when the 2030 Vision was announced everyone was saying uh this is just going to be on paper and nothing's going to happen uh and and today it's on the ground you see the the fruit you know one of our kpis was to have Saudis participate in sports half an hour or more uh reaching 40% of Saudis participate in sports half an hour or more by 2030 a day or it was a week a week yeah it was 133% in in 2015 uh so 40% of Saudis to participate half an hour or more per week um by 2030 we achieved 48% this year um and we had to change our regulations and our kpi because now we abide by the uh wh uh with 150 minutes per week so it increased uh towards that um that says to me that the people who obviously we know they're are young population they they want this 100% yeah they want to play more sport they want to be more active and we have to give them that yeah yeah uh and and develop on that but we have to do it and put the right steps towards them and work with everyone all the experts around the world to make sure that we can deliver on the right way does it frustrate you sometimes as a Saudi Prince a member of the RO family that you do so much business say with countries like the UK arms deals trade deals whenever you come any of the senior members of the family to you get fed by the royal family in our country um you own a lot of stuff in the UK and yet there still will be a lot of people in the UK who've never been here who just have an incredibly negative View of Saudi Arabia of the people the government and so on you feel frustrated by that I used to be in the beginning and then I said will that change me no will that change what we're doing no we know what we need to do we we know what's best for us and we have to keep on going despite whoever says anything about us but I really would like you know whoever has an opinion about Saudi Arabia and has never been to Saudi Arabia please come come and see our country come and meet the people on the ground I am 100% sure that your perspective about Saudi Arabia will be changed uh come and visit the kingdom come and see Saudi Arabia you know sometimes if you can't come sometimes they do exhibitions and events around uh there in the UK or around the world go and attend them and see if you are curious of course about Saudi Arabia uh and so on so please do come and see because it's a different world you know and that's the beauty of I think you get to experience other parts of the world I've traveled the Middle East for 30 odd years I've been to many don't know why I've never come here it's not been delate um but it's great to be here I I I just always have felt that if you go a lot to the Middle East you have a very different impression of it to people who never go yeah and it's just one of those realities but it's the same everywhere in the world if I you know I've never been to to any country around the world you you you only know what you hear about it but when you go and see for yourself then it's a different perspective of what it is finally Saudi 2034 is growing together as the yes the Mantra so you're going to keep growing keep growing football gets better and better you get more and more players the league gets better the Homegrown players get raised up Suddenly you think wow we've got a team here in the last the first ever World Cup in a Middle East Country in Qatar the last one you beat Argentina Saud Arabia in in the first round and they went on to win the tournament is the ultimate dream for you 2034 World Cup final Saudi Arabia they win the world cup and if so who would you most like to beat in the final um I think it's an ultimate dream for everyone you why would you compete in the World Cup if you don't want to win it um you think you can I think if we put the right steps in if we work on the right programs it's not going to be easy because everyone's working towards that a lot of countries are are much well developed and and established than we are um but I truly believe in miracles from what I've seen in this country and uh and uh from you know the leadership and so if you ask me just to relate to that if you ask me 5 years ago you're going to host Formula 1 I'm going to tell you you're dreaming we host Formula One today and I come from that field of motor sports and and and so on so I think anything is possible in sports uh I mean you've seen I think this year in in the in the in the Olympics the most medals to countries I think was awarded in the Olympics this year uh so a lot of countries with very you know economically very poor and so on but they have an Olympic champion who's won a gold medal and I think that's the beauty of sports is that it gives it gives everyone a chance to to win and and and to to to work hard towards aspiring to that goal is is it possible yes nothing is impossible who do you most want to beat England United States Donald Trump crying in the background honestly one of your neighbors yeah it would be nice to see two Gulf countries in the final and and we win in the which one which one would be more most satisfying any of them to be honest yeah any of them but but but I think no I think it doesn't make a difference if you win it Saudi free Egypt too that would be a nice result no but I think you know if you talk to to to the sports minister in Egypt he'd say the same thing about us so of course um so I think it's very it's very it's the ultimate goal for everyone yeah is it possible we've seen a lot of remarkable things in sports uh you know Morocco reaching the semi final and with amazing team Croatia with a very young population uh reaching the final I think twice you know my favorite quote Nelson Mandela who I had the pleasure of interviewing many years ago and he had this great quote it always seems impossible until it's done yeah true yeah that should be your mancha for winning the world that is our mancha growing together and it's always been impossible is unless someone doesn't here it's great to meet you to to come here and really see it for myself I think it's going to be a great World Cup inshah it will and you're all welcome to come especially you pierce and and hopefully we enjoy the matches in 203 when England beat you 5'4 in the final just don't take it out on me right let's let's wait and see we'll do the same as what we did with Argentina you're Ro H thank you very much for your time thank you so much thank you","The transcript is an extensive discussion on Saudi

y4vOuRv9jyA,Why Saudi Arabia Pours Billions Into Sport Stars (And It Makes Sense),this episode of Economics explain was brought to you by Hansen shaving countries around the world but in particular the oil Rich Gulf States are spending billions of dollars every year to sports stars largely past their Prime to play in new local leagues they're setting up these countries are no strangers to Lavish and often poorly planned spending but unlike skyscrapers and giant shapes in the deserts the economic logic to spending fundamentally limited P dollars on someone who can kick a ball good is even harder to map out Sports is a massive industry worldwide the sporting industry in the USA alone produces more economic output than all but the 70 largest economies in the world but it's also just entertainment and it's far from a predictable or reliable industry to build an economy around major sporting events like the Olympics and even the World Cup have failed to generate positive economic outcomes for the countries hosting these events in the case of the most recent World Cup held in Qatar one of the countries at the center of this trend the event mostly tarnished their reputation on the world stage with controversies over the rights and treatment of the workers that put the events together together and also strict local laws and customs that were incompatible with Western businesses and audiences particularly those that would be attending football matches even countries that have a long history and strong cultural connection towards globally viewed sports like the English Premier League have struggled to maintain teams that are profitable the Gulf States do need to diversify their economy so they don't become dependent on a limited resource that fluctuates in price every day on global markets and it's a positive step to see them making efforts towards that goal but paying billions of dollars over market prices to become the home of sport in events that struggle to make money anywhere is a questionable strategy at best realistically it would make much more sense for that money to be spent on developing other industries that could replace oil and gas long term or at the very least invested into a sovereign wealth fund that makes low-risk Investments to provide revenues to the countries into the future it's difficult for rational outside observers to look at these decisions and think that it's anything other than the proverbial smooth brain dictator that really likes golf Formula 1 or football and is using their unchecked mountains of Petro dollars to buy their own own personal play things now of course that is a real possibility and sometimes the role of an economist becomes justifying the bad decisions of the people in charge with overly generous projections but there may be a real strategy to these record-breaking contracts which at least have the potential to make a major impact on these economies during the transition they're inevitably facing over the coming decades so what is the motivation behind spending billions of dollars to develop a sports league in a country with no history of sports could this seemingly Reckless spending accelerate the underlying economic problems in these countries and finally is there a genuine economic outcome where this public expenditure is Justified one of the most effective ways to build economic Prosperity is not by developing new Industries but by reducing the waste in the ones that exist already and that's why we were so excited when the sponsor of today's video Hensen shaving reached out to us Henson shaving got it start in 2020 when the Aerospace machine shop had to Pivot away from making parts for the International Space Station in the Mars River because of disruptions caused by the global pandemic instead they use the same Manufacturing processors to make the world's best shaving equipment their machinists are far more qualified to talk about the science behind what makes this so good but as someone with delicate little baby skin that gets easily irritated by even the most premium disposable razors I used to put off shaving my face Tufts until it became socially unacceptable but let me tell you shaving with their razor is night and day the thing that really got the economics nerd in me going though was their reversal on the Razer razor blade model that's right a business model that's actually named after razors you see most shaving companies s you the Razer at a loss but then force you into buying their Replacements afterwards which is where they generate all their profit this model lets them start off with a low entry price but ultimately ends up costing you much more over time other examples of printers and ink cartridges or single-use coffee machines and pods so not only will your Hensen Razer give you a lower cost of owners share it will also help the environment and support a business that's not supporting the trend of disposable planned obsolescence okay before we get into the economics or black thereof of spending billions of dollars to play sports in the middle of the desert I want was always give a big disclaimer which in this case is that I don't follow any of these Sports and I have very little insights into who the best football or stickball or zoomi man really is and for the sake of the macroeconomic objectives of these decisions it shouldn't really matter anyway most of the attention recently has been focused around contracts given to football or soccer players from teams in the Saudi Arabian pro league now this isn't a particularly large or well-known League internationally and it doesn't attract the same viewership or sponsor dollars as better known competitors in Europe or even the US so the money to pay for these headline grabbing contracts is coming from the Saudi Arabian government the teams making these offers are majority owned by something called the public investment fund which is one of Saudi Arabia's Sovereign wealth funds a sovereign wealth fund is just a giant investment fund used mostly by oil Rich states to save oil revenues and invest into projects to decrease their economy's Reliance on oil the most famous example of such a fund and one that we've spoken about a lot on this channel before is Norway's government pension fund which has received a share of the country's oil revenues from drilling rights and from the country's state-owned oil company the revenues were reinvested into Global markets and today the country of Norway home to just 5.4 million people owns around 1.4% of all globally listed companies although despite its strong performance and immense natural resource revenues Norway's Sovereign wealth fund is no longer the largest in the world it's been overtaken by France's deposit and Consignment fund which now has over $1.4 trillion in assets this deserves a video all its own so make sure to get subscribed for that one if you aren't already the golf States in particular QA the UAE and Saudi Arabia all have their own Sovereign wealth funds which also in theory take oil revenues and use it to invest into the future of the Kingdom but unlike the funds from France Norway and even China the Gulf States have been widely criticized for being very opaque with their operations there is no available information on where these funds get their money from Beyond just State oil and there's also little information about where they invest outside of a few big purchases that attract a lot of attention like the contracts to these Sports people and occasionally entire teams inside and outside of the the countries themselves yeah that's right if their local League doesn't work out in the end the public investment fund of Saudi Arabia also owns Newcastle United which plays in the much larger English Premier League so what's the logic here is there any way that this is a sensible economic strategy the first explanation is that large sports teams are just businesses in a surprisingly large industry and investment into these International and domestic teams is no different from regular investment into regular companies like every other Sovereign wealth fund does the only reason that Saudi Arabia or Qatar paying large sums to obtain footballers and golfers is any different from Norway buying shares in apple is that regular people care more about sports stars and teams than they do about financial securities and well also perhaps understandably people are less comfortable with countries that don't have the best human rights records taking control of beloved National figures but even ignoring that sports teams are not fantastic Investments a lot of them are run at a loss by extremely wealthy people who just want to own something they grew up enjoying and every other team they compete against also comes on Under Pressure to outspend an entity that doesn't care about making any money they may be businesses like any other but they are normally bad Investments and the managers of sovereign wealth funds would know that fortunately though when an investment fund and National economy are as closely interconnected as they are in the Gulf States it might not matter if those returns are received directly through the investment fund itself the state of goal of these funds is to build national income diversity Beyond just resource revenues and that's best achieved by building local Industries just like the mega projects these countries are building in the desert don't make sense individually these sports teams could theoretically at least build a part of a major push for tourists and international business dollars Newcastle United's largest sponsor is CA a company that owns and develops the sports events industry primarily in Saudi Arabia so even if the team itself never makes any money the nation of Saudi Arabia will benefit in other ways by building themselves up as a destination for sports fans All Over The World Industries like this attract a lot of employment and require a lot of businesses to accommodate for all of the supporting industries that spring up around it realistically of course it's still probably the case that the decision makers at the helm of these multi-billion dollar investment funds just really wanted to play pay to win real life FIFA manager but if nothing else it does have the potential to work in line with the general strategy of replacing oil revenues with revenues generated from being a regional business and tourist Hub but that will work better for some countries than others and economic advisors within these countries themselves should at least raise the issue of the gulf State's other problems people will travel to distant countries to watch their favorite sports people play and big names may even attract attention to local leagues in the golf states which can in turn be used as a way to show off the country as a genuine tourist and business destination with the addition of Mega projects low taxes and a convenient central location it is an attractive offering to businesses that want to at the very least get a cut out of this seemingly Reckless spending and to see how this could play out we need to look at California California as we know today really got it start in the Gold Rush of the mid 1800s before then there wasn't much driving people to an area that was so remote and offered little advantages beyond what could be found in the east of the USA But as people made the trick to seek out their fortunes towns sprung up to support the miners and then cities developed to support the people supporting the miners and then Industries developed that had nothing to do with mining at all today the state of California is one of the largest economies in the world with an output similar to that of Germany which itself is a true economic superpower now this type of gold rush in the case of the Gulf States is not going to be for all o these days natural resource extraction is handled by multinational corporations using billions of dollars worth of Capital Equipment rather than huge groups of men with pickaxes what the golf states are instead in effect doing is creating a man-made go rush for businesses to set up operations in their country to make their fortunes not by digging for gold but by digging for big state contracts already some of these countries have started to develop industries that support the industry supporting the oil industry and the governments of these states have encouraged this by making investments into things like National Airlines which not only have the potential to generate revenues in a sustainable value adding industry in their own right they also effectively force people to stop over in Qatar Dubai or Abu Dhabi even Saudi Arabia the major Gulf State which has typically been the most insular and geopolitically problematic has moved ahead with plans to introduce their own national airline to compete with their golf State neighbors adding Sports to the mix will give people another reason to stop over another reason to host a conference in a country conveniently between two major economic regions another reason to build Hotel open restaurants and everything else in between Saudi Arabia in particular is highly unlikely to ever profit directly from these record-breaking Sports deals but in the inevitable Race Against Time that they find themselves in spending a tiny fraction of their resource revenues on an industry that could speed up their transition to a self-sustaining economy by even just a few years is a gamble worth making now whether this really is the long-term vision of the Saudi government is impossible to say because again their spending is not openly reported and their government doesn't need to answer questions to its people like governments do in the west but to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that this spending does tie into the grand strategic vision of the country and its economy long term there are still some major challenges lack of public knowledge about the Gulf States is not their biggest problem they are not some Hidden Gem that tourists have been missing out on for decades if anything the problem is that people know too much about them emic corruption cronyism controlled media appalling migrant workers rights the fun of questionable groups around the world all on top of Simply different cultural values to most of the rest of the advanced World means that these countries are often the target of criticism anybody looking to set up a business in these countries or move there to work or simply do an extended layover to enjoy a football game or Formula 1 race is going to know about these problems some people just don't care and they want a convenient place to stop over on a cost-effective airline where they can stay in a fancy hotel and take photos for the gram in front of the latest oil funded Mega project this is is especially true for businesses that are quick to put morals aside when there is this much money to be made but it's also not fair to assume that these countries can't change California before and during its Gold Rush was a very rough Place Singapore which is a model that these states are trying to emulate was also far from an ideal place for most Global Industries it had a lot of the same challenges and a lot of the same problems that these countries do today yet when people think of Singapore they mostly think of a safe clean Metropolitan city with most people stopping to consider its unusual laws well the fact that its government has ruled basically unchallenged for the last 40 years a bad Public Image will slow these countries down but it's not enough to stop these economies from becoming Advanced value adding centers and that's probably a good thing closing countries often refusing to engage with them because of domestic problems will cause isolationism which long term is likely to only make the problems worse sport of all things is a great way to bring people together across borders and perhaps even give opportunities to these countries to be exposed po to some healthy criticism the problems of Migrant labor wouldn't have gotten the attention they're currently getting if it wasn't for the World Cup in Qatar nor would the conflict in Yemen without the Formula 1 in Saudi Arabia if these countries want to make these Investments work and open up to the world then they're going to have to address these issues where the alternative is them hoarding their oil wealth and staying stuck in their old ways sure people may not like them taking away their favorite sports stars but arguably it's a small price to pay for the potential that these countries become developed members of the modern world using sport for this is nothing new international sporting events have been held in countries with poor human rights records for as long as there have been International sporting events up and cominging and yes it has to be said authoritarian countries have always used big sporting events to show off their country and their people on a global stage and cover over their underlying problems with big flashy festivities it's a practice so common it has its own name sportswashing but in recent decades this has become even more pronounced thanks to a larger Global trend no economy in the world today can be an island the only one that comes close is the USA which still benefits tremendously from global trade Global schools transfers Global Investments and Global Travel countries like the Gulf States whether they would openly admit it or not owe all the prosperity they've achieved in recent decades to globalization Global skills have let them establish world-class oil extraction facilities Global Investments funded it global trade let them export their energy all over the world and global migration let them turn that money into big shining cities in the deserts and even let them buy into sports all across the world so far their International reputation hasn't really mattered because oil is a fungible commodity and most people have no idea where the stuff they put in their car originated from there are rare instances where natural resource exports can be sanctioned but countries normally need to make major missteps for that to be an issue other Global Industries are more dependent on this perception though and as the world is now reassessing complex Global Supply chains with potential Rivals lines have been drawn across the globe and countries that have benefited from both sides need to to maintain the status quo by any means necessary more people pay attention to sport than they do trade deals and political negotiations having exposure to an audience of billions of people can make political backlash against policy makers a very real threat the cost of these deals may seem crazy to regular people like you or I but to these countries it's a valuable marketing tool that could help secure the future of their economic Prosperity at best or at worst it's a political insurance policy that costs less than a percent of the money they have saved up from an industry they're trying to buy way out of Saudi Arabia may be home to the most profitable company in history but it's still ultimately unsustainable and it still pales in comparison to the influence of another company in the early years of a truly global economy we put together an entire video on the Dutch East India Company over on Epic economics which you should be able to click to on your screen now thanks for watching mate bye,"The transcript discusses the substantial investments made by oil-rich Gulf states, particularly Saudi Arabia, in building local sports leagues by signing high-profile athletes. It questions the economic rationale behind these investments, especially since sports are seen as an unpredictable industry and often fail to generate significant economic benefits. The transcript criticizes this strategy as a part of potentially misguided attempts to diversify economies dependent on oil revenues. It also highlights concerns over human rights controversies, such as those associated with the Qatar World Cup and strict local laws. The investments are described as actions of ""smooth brain dictators"" using wealth to purchase personal interests. The discussion considers if these state-funded contracts form part of a broader economic strategy to transform these nations into tourism and business hubs. A comparison is made to historical economic success stories like California's Gold Rush and Singapore's transformation, suggesting potential long-term economic benefits. However, the overseeing lack of transparency and human rights issues in these regions, plus the need for these countries to address underlying systemic problems, are emphasized. The transcript further identifies these efforts as ""sportswashing,"" where these nations seek to improve their global image through sports. The transcript argues that while the global economic interconnectedness of today could eventually lead to positive changes, the success of this strategy depends significantly on the Gulf states' willingness to reform beyond flashy investments.",Sportswashing,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Saudi Arabia
KrmqY9hyCCw,Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman 'will continue sportswashing',you are spending a ton on Sports a lot of money big names that people are very familiar with big teams big facilities what do you say to the people who charge that that's part of Sports washing that you're trying to use all of that to somehow improve or somehow affect your image what if a sports Washington going to increase one percent and then it will continue doing spot washing you're okay with that term I I don't care I have one percent growth of GDP from Sport and I'm aiming for another one and a half percent call us whatever you want we're going to get that one and a half percent,"The transcript features a discussion about a substantial financial investment in sports, likely by a Gulf nation, focusing on high-profile athletes, notable teams, and large-scale facilities. The speaker addresses accusations of sportswashing, dismissing concerns and emphasizing the economic benefits, specifically GDP growth, stemming from these investments. The speaker indicates a pragmatic approach, prioritizing economic gains over reputational issues, showing indifference to the label of sportswashing if it results in a targeted increase in GDP.",Sportswashing,1,No,Saudi Pro League,Saudi Arabia
jNdQb-958hA,Has The UFC Sold Out To Oil Money? Letting Fighters Cheat With A Certain Background? EXPOSED?,this is a very important video that I'm making right now so I'm going to word things very very carefully okay are the UFC being paid Millions to have their events in Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia yes they are and I have no problem with that because that's just good business and it makes sense to try and break into a new market however as I let this video play in the background of Dana White meeking turkey alesik who's paying all of these boxers to have their big fights over there and now he's doing the same for the UFC to come to Saudi Arabia are the UFC artificially letting certain Fighters and I'm not going to say what type of Fighters because I know that's a Minefield no pun intended [ __ ] sorry are they letting certain Fighters that can better relate to an audience from Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi cheat in fights I mean we can go through the wood versus n Mo fight today which I'm going to do I'm going to show you a bunch of examples are they making up new rules for what should happen after an illegal knee to the face that stops a fight they gave anal a no contest they gave Yan no belt what's the difference there isn't one there's also this more cheating we're going to go through today and these scorecards from the UFC Saudi Arabia card and from the other card that they have in Abu Dhabi most recently which was makev versus volkanovski 2 very very important to mention that 90% of the examples I'm going to use today are all from just two cards one in Abu Dhabi one in Saudi Arabia I'm going to be very careful with the way I mention things I'm going to get into why I think this is happening afterwards but first of all I just want to let you see this image real quick before I try and convince you that maybe the UFC is illing out a little bit let's have a little look just going to let it play we're going to get into my examples in a second I just wanted you to see that image I wanted you to see that image right there and we're going to get into some examples okay this is from the last two Abu Dhabi cards and I've noticed this on the Saudi Arabia card and I've noticed it on the Abu Dhabi card before um this is from Saudi Arabia though sorry we just were there we watched maged sherov no no that's not his name um sharam magedov we watched him you know the pirate he's a big name coming up everyone's talking about him he fought an absolute can they gave him a layup of an opponent in troli it was a short notice mix up though so it's all okay and in that fight he performed one of the most egregious fence grabs in recent UFC history fact here we see him against troli troli is going for a taked down he's trying to get his leg between um he's getting getting his leg around shz so he can uh leverage towards his left once he's got the body lock whilst Shara magedov is stuck on one leg and he can step through with his left leg here which is what he's doing troli to knock off the balance of Sharon magedov on his rear leg as well without this fence grab Shara magedov is done he's not done for he's on the ground and he's probably by the positioning of the legs he's probably in half guard on bottom position okay and judging from his Bruno Silva fights that's a really good position to have Sharon magedov in now I don't mind that he grabbed the cage it's cheating absolutely horrendous shouldn't be done but we see people grab the cage all the time the problem I have is that when people grab the cage and get away with it the referee doesn't see Edwards did this against Usman in a title fight and immediately got a point deducted I want to show you this Mark Godard is the ref here okay I don't care that he grabbed the cage what I really care about is that Mark Godard watched him grab the cage let him grab the cage watched it stop a takeown saw it warned him about it you're not allowed to stop takedowns with a fence grab this is absolutely a completed takedown look how off balance Sharon magedov is in this position if he isn't grabbing the cage he is getting sent to the canvas on bottom position with a minute to go and this is very bad as well because after this troli got hurt to the body by Shara magedov and started to look like he was fading after this so he really needed this takedown and Godard saw it and Godard warned him told him not to and proceeded to not take a single point away from him or even separate the fight and give troli a position on the bottom he did nothing about this and this was one of the most blatant fence grabs we have seen in recent MMA history I go through some other examples here because that's just not one one of them is not enough and by the way this is across two cards that I'm going to show you today should I stick to the Saudi Arabia card first maybe I should no let's go through it in this order because I've set it up this way Nathaniel Wood versus Muhammad naov now again a fighter in Muhammad naov that could very very he could be very beneficial to the UFC by signing this deal with Saudi Arabia to have someone that's a bit more relatable to the native population I completely understand they should want naov to win because they're pushing for this Market it's the same way they wanted yayer and Moreno to win when they had the UFC Pi being built in Mexico and wanted Grasso to win they just rigged a scorecard for her against Valentina shev shenko but that's not what this is about we're talking about this specific deal because there's hundreds of millions going on right here in terms of a deal to have these events in Saudi Arabia and it's clearly very important because the last Saudi card that they proposed was weak as [ __ ] and Saudi put their foot down and said no we're not having that card you're putting on a real card for us that needs to be mentioned as well and then theyed Whit chv on a fight night you know how many pay-per-views that would sell they put it on a Fight Night for Saudi Arabia I want to show you Wood versus n Mo this is on the volkanovski makev 2 card which was in Abu Dhabi naov knes him in the groin in the first round he does it twice okay he knees him in the groin this is Nathaniel wood by the way I hope he watches this I see you I saw what happened to you brother I saw it we all saw it but I don't think people saw how bad it was he needs na wood in a grin a grin shot no big deal they separate they watch the replay he gets a warning okay after that grin shot he then need Nathaniel wood straight in the sternum as well by the way right in the solar plex right there right in the in the in the bread basket with another knee and wood had to take a groin shot and then a shot to the body as well then muhamad naov in round two grabbed the cage against wood well early on he actually hit another groin shot on wood so he's been warned and he hit another groin shot on wood and he hit the cup with a front Kick That was supposed to be to the body now not that bad I completely get it the referee was like okay it was accidental I'm not going to take a point away I could but I'm not going to I wouldn't assume bias yet naov grabs the [ __ ] fence covering or the cage whatever you call this little padded thing to stop a taked down from Nathaniel wood in round two this is after he's already groin shotted him twice he's stopping a takedown with this and he grabs it twice the referee warns him and he puts his hand up and says sorry so again in this area of the world a referee has seen a fighter that would better relate to the audience from that area cheat blatantly stop aate down with it the ref has seen it has called him on it he's responded to the ref and the ref has done nothing about this naov went on to reverse this position and take down wood in round two and win that round arguably because of it awful terrible they let him get away with it well it's not like he's going to keep fouling and they're still going to let him get away with it right that's already three or four two cage grabs two groin shots still no point okay maybe not that bad he headbutts Nathaniel wood in round two as well crashes forward and headbuts him now this is round three not bad maybe unnoticeable by the ref head clashes happen quite a lot in the sport not that bad a okay with that call if there wasn't other fouls I'd be less angry it's all good he's spinning heel kicks Nathaniel wood in the groin the commentary at the time hear it and say he just hit him in the groin again I heard the cup maybe accidental but he's hit him in the groin again that's three groin shots two cage grabs and one headbutt from mhamed Nimo warnings across the board not one point has been taken Nathaniel wood ends up on top in the third round he's been waiting to Break N of the entire fight ends up on top lands a vicious ground and pound shot on him really badly stuns him with it on the ground and Nyo starts to grab his gloves okay there's a whole other screen of his cheats grabs the glove here Nathaniel wood punches again and what is naov doing he's grabbing the glove the referee sees this he's still grabbing the glove here right in front of the referee during what is nearly a finishing sequence from Nathaniel wood by the way before this naov is wobbled earlier that round he's breaking he's very clearly not wanting to be in there in there anymore he wants to survive until the final Bell he's breaking out there and Nathaniel wood is starting to put it on him badly and he's trying to survive that's what's happening here and wood is beating him up on the ground in round three looking for a finish Nyo grabs the glove again uh glove again the ref sees him this is the referee's hand pointing at the glove grab he sees him do it after two groin shots two cage grabs a headbutt and whatever else I mentioned here uh the spinning three grin shots sorry three of them the referee has still not done anything to stop naov or take a point or have anything benefit wood in this fight he grabs the glove again here the referee's hand comes in Wood still trying to punch with his free hand on naov but look what nimo's doing he's still hooking the glove the referee steps in again because he hooks the glove again at the end of the fight that's two glove grabs now that the referee has seen let alone the ones he hasn't that he's seen these two and he's done nothing about it and naov gets to win by decision with no point deductions the most fouls ever committed in UFC history and not one point was deducted that's not where it ends anv need Johnny Walker in the face and Johnny Walker was deemed not able to continue an KV got given a no contest because it was deemed accidental okay accidental it was deemed he knew what he was doing he need Johnny Walker in the head he wasn't thinking at the time maybe he wasn't like H make sure I don't KN him in the face right now he was going with the flow of the fight but he committed a foul and it's intentional that he need him in the face but it was considered accidental he accidentally need Walker in the face it doesn't count that he accidentally committed a foul that's still a foul which is why Yan had his belt stripped away from him they deemed Yan intentional and therefore they took away his world championship belt from him this also happened on the very same card of analiia versus Walker okay I'm going to show you real quick this is Cedric Dumas versus Abu aitar you can go back and watch any of these fights I'm not making stuff up I wouldn't do that I need some credibility okay I can't just call Jon Jones gay and have a career out of it sedric Dumas gets his head grabbed by Abu aah now from this angle you're thinking okay he's getting a single like he's tying up in the clinch he's trying to tie up in the clinch and do something with it okay he's got the back of sedric dumas's head he then grips the braids of sedric Dumas okay and his friend punches at him in this sequence as well Abu AA who again is another fighter in all of these examples accidentally that could very helpfully relate to a Saudi Arabian or an Abu dhaban audience okay he's now got sadri deas held hostage by the dreads okay he's got this guy held hostage by the dreads and he's winding up punches on him whilst having him held captive by his own dreads okay he punches him in the face while he's got a hold of his dreads he grabs him again by the dreads punches him in the head and then he still got a hold of his dreads and punches it again was there a point deducted for this no there wasn't J Herzog was the referee in this fight he stopped the fight he said okay something clearly went on there let's check the replay he watched this on replay Abu aitar gripping the dreads and holding sedric Dumas by his dreads and punching him in the face whilst doing it and he said accidental no point deduction you can watch the fight yourself I can't use UFC footage I've been trying to upload this video all day and they keep getting it taken down because I'm using little bits of footage the [ __ ] annoying company Man 1 FC literally offered to let me use their content be more like one FC either way Abu AA is punching this guy in the head while having a grip of his dreads deemed accidental by the way but yansy over aljo intentional take his belt away this is within two events in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi two we go on Naz hack prast versus Jared Gordon that was a [ __ ] robbery Gordon should have won that fight end of discussion Gordon should have won that fight he got it taken away from him and they gave it to nazra aaras not that bad I guess but when you tie it in with the bunch of other examples within the space of two [ __ ] cards it gets a bit suspicious and when I'm looking at this you can't even read this because I couldn't get a good enough screen capture of it but you can maybe make out that this is a scorecard being read for this fight below of gulov or Brenson riro guess who they might be biased towards over there it's not Brenson riro the [ __ ] Brazilian it's magamed gadisov I want to tell you right now you see these round three stats where gelov was 7 to one on significant strikes and just basically laid on top in half guard doing basically nothing the whole round he got a 108 round for that okay I'm not saying they gave him a robbery decision this judge veto patillo whatever his [ __ ] name is we never know what his face is that's a thing about these judges scored that fight a draw a lot of you probably don't even know that because you probably just saw gads love get his hand raised and thought okay 2928 him he scored the fight a draw now when I first saw that I thought this guy's giving draw rounds out he's got a round scored 99 out there what is he doing and I realized no he doesn't have a round scored 99 he scored the first two rounds to Brenson riro which by the way I think is incorrect to do he scored the first two rounds to Brenson riro and then for no reason at all gave gadilo a 108 in round three the worst 108 we maybe have ever seen outside of maybe grao shev shenko when they were building the ufcp no coincidence at all and maybe outside of Usman versus chv which also happened in Abu Dhabi on makev versus volkanovski too chv was unanimously given on every scorecard a 108 round in the first round of that fight now in an ideal world is that a 108 round yes but let me tell you something right now in terms of high-profile fights outside of the one judge that gave grao shevchenko round five a 108 to Grasso which gave her the draw and saved her title they just built a ufcpi in Mexico it's all good outside of that and outside of this which is another example on the just the two cards outside of that this is the most lenient 108 round and easiest 108 round I've ever seen given in maybe U recent UFC history he did not do that much damage to Usman in round one and then they just sort of scattered over what rounds to give him in rounds two and three eventually giving chv the win I thought Usman won the second and third round damage based scoring he landed the better shots but when these guys are on top and I'm not even going to get into other stuff but this is within the space of two cards guys I wouldn't be doing this if it was a cross the distance of like two three years coincidence maybe they were just bad refs that day and it just happened to be in their area this is within two [ __ ] cards two single cards guys two we don't see these types of fouls more than once a year and within two cards egregious fouls benefit benefiting One Direction of fighter it's crazy it is crazy to me and we see him shaking hands with these guys hundreds of millions bring your events to Saudi Arabia this as well listen to this people also wondering a lot about sha if he can compete in United States can he yes probably not we'll keep him out here l l l l l these guys because of the current political state of the world not even going to get into it you know why they're not allowed to compete in the US they have to compete in the UAE or Saudi Arabia so basically without these guys succeeding and these Fighters succeeding there is no UFC Saudi Arabia there is no UFC Abu Dhabi you know that Abu Dhabi who's the main event oh we got to scramble to get makev on there quick we they won't allow anything else we have to Saudi Arabia what card should we put on oh that's a [ __ ] card we're not having that UFC uh sorry we'll do Whit chv sorry please give us your hundreds of millions to have the events there please you know what I mean we can go through this again uman Edo versus Corey sandhagen Umar getting sandhagen figero in the co-main event former flyweight Champion two fight win streak at bantamweight better wins at Banton weight the new man magedov and he's a [ __ ] maybe third greatest flyweight of all time I can say that comfortably I think and he's getting skipped up he's getting Rob or he's getting Maron Vera in the very same card umar's getting the main event spot in Abu Dhabi for a fight night when you don't have these guys succeeding you don't have these events in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi and when you don't have the events in Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia you lose hundreds of [ __ ] millions of dollarss okay and that's what I'm worried about right now I'm not saying that they're intentionally doing this I'm not saying any of that I'm just noticing Trends that's all I'm doing okay and what I know is when you start making hundreds of millions of money more when you start making hundreds of millions more and you're a business when you start bringing in that extra income every month every year whatever it is based on the deal and you start bringing in that income guess what else you start doing you start raising your expenses because now you can because you have that money coming in and you're raising your expenses and what that does is that subconsciously makes a company dependent on that money coming in when they have money coming in and the reason and and they raise their expenses outwards from their business because of that money coming in now all of a sudden if that money stops coming in their expenses are going to have to start coming coming down or maybe they've locked themselves into some kind of expense that they're not going to just be able to bring back down so they're going to need that money this is the problem I have and it's the same problem boxing is going to have I'm not even listen to what I've done on this video I've not said there a [ __ ] crowd of non-w Warriors that don't understand combat and they just sit there and golf clap no Aura whatsoever I'm not saying any of that in this video I could go into all of that and say this is why it's destroying the sport why is it at this time like cuz in you know the UFC at least there's guys from that region of the world is because they're not anywhere near that region but they represent that region of course I'm not going to get into why [ __ ] hell um but still I'm sweating so much is so hot in the UK right now but still in boxing we see AG like Fury usyk happening out there that should be in Wembley Stadium Fury versus usyk unification belt Undisputed that should be in Wembley Stadium or guess what even without the war it should be in a in a [ __ ] Battlefield in Ukraine that fight should take place AJ versus in GH I should be in Wembley or guess what Cameroon or Las Vegas that should not be in Saudi Arabia oh Ronaldo's in the audience everyone look didn't we put on an hour Festival enough between the co-main and Main Event it's [ __ ] it's ruining it but that's not what this video is about they're becoming dependent on this Mana to have these events and when that happens you get Shah being allowed to get away with the most egregious fence grab in recent UFC history you get naov committing one of the worst nine 10 no points deducted oh it was an accident guys give it a no contest already intentional take Yan's belt it was an accident you guys he didn't mean to grip him by his [ __ ] dreads and hold him hostage by them and punch him in the face while doing it it was an accident guys oh just a nazat decision guys don't worry about it h just a 108 to JV oh well looks like Usman can't possibly win without a finish now even though he clearly got the last two rounds don't worry guys just the most easy 108 round we've ever given in UFC history to maged gadisov by a guy who maybe accidentally scored the first two rounds to riro and realized oh [ __ ] if I don't give this a 108 I'm scoring it against this guy let me give him a 108 round real quick what is going on and I ain't even showed you some [ __ ] man Abu Dhabi they start going to Abu Dhabi khabib's their front runner khabib's their big name that they have khabib Nam magedov missed weight against Justin gatei and the officials in Abu Dhabi let him do it I don't know if they let him do it I take that back I'm playing a character man I hate that after walk on eggshells man the UFC or the Commission in Abu Dhabi made such a mistake that khabib namag medov in his big retirement fight against Justin gaii was allowed to Mis weight for a championship fight not by him pushing down on the tow not by him taking one foot off the scale this isn't on khabib when khabib looked terrible in his weight weight cut for the gaii fight look at the scales guys if you don't know how these types of scales work I'm going to tell you right now this is set at 155b that's the weight that khabib is supposed to weigh for his title fight against Justin gai if it is he's about to shift it to 155 I think right yeah that's what he's about to do what oh no no he's got to let loose this so he can see if it's stable or not now when he lets this loose this is set at Championship weight 155 if he is at at Championship weight this balance counterbalance will stay stable it's set to a force of 155 if the force on the scale is 155 it won't move or budge if the force on the scale is over 155 it will Sway and it will move upwards and hit the top of the scale this is supposed to stay steady if khabib weighs 155s and no guy just goes yep and scoots it along that scale did not balance out at 15 155 [ __ ] pounds commission and it the fact that you watched it not do that and then just went 155 is one of the most insane things the scale goes up before he has made second contact with it the scale has moved from the balance area to an area which dictates he has not made5 he has not made contact with the scale yet it has hit the roof 155 he says whilst watching it with his two eyes not be 155 an accident maybe commission over there khabib gets to fight Abu Dhabi gets there huge event with Justin gatei in the main event and khabib ends up winning he probably would have won anyway but you know what I'm saying I'm not taking this out on khabib Oram or makev what I'm saying is outside of the khabib fake weigh-in moment which Ola don't get the [ __ ] credit for when his scales off by 0. five but the scale backstage says he's on weight what do you know [ __ ] strip him now makev gets a title shot over Bobby green after beating him on a week's notice because now ol is fighting for a vacant belt so it's more justifiable where did that fight take place in Abu Dhabi dude these guys are great Fighters kabib makev anv uman magedov they are phenomenal Fighters and with or without this rigging they likely would be the dominant forces that they are but when you look at this over the past two cards and I tell you Shara magedov got offered Paulo Costa or Marvin VOR sorry after beating Bruno Silva and this is not the same Bruno Silva that you know fought Pereira who was on a four-fight win streak and number 15 in the middleweight division he was on a losing streak he's been on a skid he's never looked the same since Pereira shattered his face shed beat Shar magedov beat him got offered Marvin vtori he won his debut fight in the UFC middleweight division he got offered Marvin vtori next the fight never ended up happening ikram alisov beat who Phil hores the chinni fighter in UFC middleweight history bottom of the barrel been koed so many [ __ ] times who did he get authored Paulo Costa up the top of the rankings oh Matt jv's out of the event Usman said he said yes to the Whitaker fight Ali abdulaziz came out and said that Usman said yes to the Whitaker fight nobody wanted to fight Whitaker on short notice guys it's got to be a kisar of I'm sick of it man and it's nothing to do with a fight they are great Fighters and I'm coming around to him makev one of my favorite Personalities in the UFC dude's got some good onliners he's funny and he's really entertaining you can't call him boring anymore he's very entertaining and a great champ always shows up has a good fight most of the time you know Vault fight was really fun the porier fight was really fun and if it's not really fun it's CU he smoked him I'm not targeting the fighters I'm noticing Trends and I'm very good at noticing Trends and when you take away the khabib moment and you just simply look at all of this [ __ ] [ __ ] that should be taking place over the stretch of four years in the US and when you see it take place within two events and in every situation it benefits hamat chv alhamdulillah it benefited him magedov alhamdulillah it [ __ ] benefited him nazra akar whoow stuff that benefited him alhamdulillah thank God all right what a coincidence OT Abu he still [ __ ] lost but this call benefited him wow it benefited anv what a [ __ ] surprise guys that's crazy wow this benefited Muhammad naov Muhammad naov That's crazy dude wow all of these cheats wow it benefited Shar magedov dude that's insane dude hundreds of millions of dollars you say to have your events in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi you say oh no dude you're kind of owing Abu Dhabi because they saved you during the pandemic oh no dude that's crazy dude they're the only reason you even had [ __ ] shows on during the pandemic holy [ __ ] dude let khabib Miss weight dude hundreds of millions of dollars dude we need these guys in the main events guys I'm losing my [ __ ] mind I needed to make this video to get it off my chest please don't let me be the only one noticing this [ __ ] share this video I'm coming around to the guy these Fighters they're good they're really good man I'm coming around to them there's something Shady going on over there dude and Fighters are being wronged and I tell you this right now if you ain't Muslim don't you ever go fight in Abu Dhabi or Saudi Arabia hey Jared Gordon I tell you why see you later goodbye tle pit,"The transcript critiques the UFC's expanding events in Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia, accusing them of compromising the sport's integrity for financial gain. The speaker, while acknowledging the business sense of entering new markets, raises concerns about potential bias favoring fighters from Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi. The video outlines multiple examples of fights where rules were purportedly bent or inconsistently enforced, alleging favoritism and cheating, such as fence grabs, illegal strikes, and other fouls, often unpunished or leading to dubious decisions. Specific instances include the handling of fights involving Shara Magomedov, Muhammed Naov, and others, with claims that fighters from the region receive undue advantages to foster the UFC’s market growth there. The speaker suggests that these actions tie into larger financial deals the UFC has in the region and expresses concern that such partnerships may lead the UFC to subconsciously bias their events to secure profits. The video implies that mismanagement of fights may be more than mere incompetence, proposing it might be part of a larger systemic issue arising from lucrative contracts and geopolitical dependencies. The transcript concludes with a stern warning against non-Muslim fighters competing in these regions due to perceived biases and expresses frustration at the overall situation.",Sportswashing,-1,No,,Saudi Arabia
gHv0Fjq3GTM,Saudi Arabia's Oil; Saudi Arabia and 9/11; Sportswashing | 60 Minutes Full Episodes,the good news is that the price of oil is falling a lot it's also the bad news if you're determined that the U.S kick its addiction to foreign oil president-elect Barack Obama says now is the time to do that even with the economy in recession but the oil Kingdom Saudi Arabia the world's largest supplier of oil with the U.S as its number one customer is pulling all the levers and spending billions to keep the oil age going we went to Saudi Arabia a few weeks ago to meet one of the most powerful men in the world Ali al-naimi the Saudi oil Minister and de facto head of OPEC the oil cartel if most Americans had an opportunity to sit down with the oil minister of Saudi Arabia the thing they would like to know is where you think the price of oil is going to be say in about six months is it going to be up or down you want my classic answer no I want your honest okay appraisal judgment my honest judgment is if I were to know what the price of oil six months from now I would be in Las Vegas [Laughter] he may be smiling but this is a man with serious heartburn and vertigo the price of oil has been soaring and sinking up and down uncontrollably why did the price in your opinion spike in July why did it go way up to a 147 dollars a barrel basically there was a what's called a fear premium and the fear was that Saudi Arabia itself had peaked out that you'd reached your ceiling of how much available oil is left in in your overall Reserve so what's the truth the truth is here is the kingdom with more than 260 billion battles and I firmly believe that the potential to add another 200 billion barrels of oil are there to be found if the oil minister of Saudi Arabia had one message it was there is no need for those fears and to make the point they let us see facilities that'll increase Saudi capacity from about 10 million barrels a day to more than 12 million and they're going to the ends of the Earth to do it this is Sheba a desert Wilderness where temperatures can reach 135 degrees the Saudis say that 18 billion barrels of oil lie beneath these red sand dunes more than four times The Proven reserves of Alaska to tap into it the Kingdom's National Oil Company Saudi aramco had to build an oasis here the Sheba story is an amazing story al-shamari oversees the mega project at Sheba here in the Kingdom's empty quarter we're on soft sand we're not talking about a hard surface here look this is what it's like here I mean this is soft yeah the logistics are impossible the first thing we had to do is build our own Road in order to access this to get here just to get here once that was done we had to remove 100 million cubic feet of sand just to make the runway that we are currently using 100 million yeah we had to remove a sand dune in order to connect two flat areas to do that what about pipelines we built a pipeline 400 miles in length and you can imagine the challenge of building that pipeline in a topography like this but it was nothing compared to accessing the oil itself which was discovered in 1968 but for 30 years was considered too hard to extract now with sand dunes this high it's almost impossible and the economics just didn't make it at the time until the development of the horizontal drilling that's where you place a Derrick on firm ground then dig down with a drill bit that snakes horizontally under the sand dunes with branching tentacles like a fish bone the drill bits can travel out for as much as five miles you know when when we were growing up we always heard about the building of the pyramids this sounds like the building of the pyramids it was a huge task for everybody the Sheba facility is now being expanded to extract a total of 750 000 barrels a day of high-grade Arab extra light crude and when will you see the first drop of oil out of the new part right behind you we will operate this facility very early next year so the beginning of all nine absolutely then on the other side of the Kingdom there's an even bigger Mega project at a field known as caraeus it's also scheduled to go online next year this is the biggest oil project in history Khalid Abdul kedar the project manager says 1.2 million barrels a day will be tapped here that's more than the entire daily production of some OPEC countries like Qatar and Indonesia wow this is a lot of walking the oil will be stored in massive tanks like this one which is seven stories high look at this yes that is gigantic it's 300 feet across the length of a football field so can we go down can we yes okay be careful be very careful like just about everything at caraeus even the tanks have the latest bells and whistles this is a floating roof yeah so when oil comes in the whole roof which is rise up flies up yes and the stair also will rise up with it so in other words we're standing on the roof of the tank and the oil will push it up we'll push it up all the way up there's more oil in this one field at caraeus than in the entire United States it's the largest oil facility to come online anywhere in the world in nearly three decades with the Saudi say 27 billion barrels of oil has anybody projected how many years it's going to take to deplete it will take us more than 50 years 50 yes correas like the sand dunes presented a technological challenge the field has very little natural pressure which is necessary to bring the oil to the surface so to force the oil up they're injecting sea water down deep underground we will inject about 84 million of gallon per day of seawater so where's the sea water coming from because we're here in the middle of the desert how far away is the sea it is about 150 miles from here so in in addition to all of this for the oil you're also building a pipeline from the pipeline to get the additional water all the way to here the complexity and vastness of the project are staggering with 26 contractors 106 subcontractors and 22 000 workers from around the world who have laid thousands of miles of Pipeline and cables how much steel are you using here because I I'm looking it's just steel as far as I can see see we have enough structure still here that will build two Bridges equivalent size of the Golden Gate bridges in California two two these two Mega projects plus three others are costing Saudi Arabia a total of 60 billion dollars over five years and they're not borrowing any of it it's all being paid for in cash still Saudi costs for producing oil are the lowest in the world how much does it cost Saudi Arabia to produce one barrel of oil this is an excellent question it is very small very little it's probably less than two dollars to to produce a barrel Saudi Arabia reportedly needs to sell oil for at least fifty five dollars a barrel to cover the cost of running the country fossil fuels Finance 75 percent of its entire domestic spending budget but oil has sunk below that break-even price does this worry you does this send chills through your through your spine I'm not aware I get concerned but I don't worry are you concerned the concern is this any price must be good for the producer for the consumer for the investor the oil companies so you're saying if the price goes too low then then production will fall and in the end will be squeezed we won't have enough oil to run our country we'll Skyrocket what he wants is an end to the wild swings in price which is why to keep the price from further plummeting he agreed to a cut of 1.5 million barrels a day in the October meeting of OPEC the oil cartel the point is that that Saudi Arabia wanted the 1.5 this was not something jammed down your throat no this is no no it's not by the way nothing gets jammed oh the on our throats but Iran wanted more well I mean different countries want different levels different cuts but in the final analysis reason prevails but are you saying that Saudi Arabia influence on OPEC influence so strong now that he was able to quash Iran's attempt to double the price of oil which Tehran needs to support its budget including its nuclear program and the bank rolling of militias like Hezbollah and Hamas still all naimi says oil is no longer used as a weapon Iran tries to keep the price way up and Venezuela is trying to keep the price way up that you don't consider that oil as a weapon if you looked at these sentences you just named yes every one of them would like to sell every battle they can as it's higher prices as they can get away with right the sense out of the OPEC meeting to a lot of people was by cutting production your purpose was to get the price up again and that would hurt the world which is suffering an economic crisis and the world means everywhere I can assure you that price was the least on our mind but of course I say that in all honesty but the sense is you were oblivious to the concerns of of the world facing this economic crisis you didn't care about uh the recession the credit problems or anything like that that is really a very unfair criticism what did governments do when the financial crisis happened they took measures to bring stability back to the financial market and we see because of our responsibility a future crisis in the oil Market should we not take preemptive measures to prevent it and I think the answer is yes we should it's incumbent on us not to see the oil Market destroyed the Saudis recently announced the price they would like to see oil selling for 75 dollars a barrel about 50 percent higher than the current price are they trying to keep the U.S addicted to oil their answer when we come back Saudi aramco was originally an American company it goes way back to the 1930s when two American geologists from Standard Oil of California discovered oil in the Saudi desert standard oil formed a Consortium with Texaco Exxon and mobile which became a ramco it wasn't until the 1980s that Saudi Arabia bought them out and nationalized the company today Saudi aramco is the custodian of the country's sole source of wealth and power Saudi aramco is a massive complex along the Persian Gulf hundreds of miles east of the mega projects over sixteen thousand people work here at the company's compound which is like a little country with its own security Force schools hospitals even its own Airline is president and CEO of Saudi aramco so this is your headquarters this is our headquarters and uh how big is a ramco Saudi aramco is the world's largest oil producing company and it's the richest company in the world worth according to the latest estimate 781 billion dollars this is the heart of our operation this is the nerve center it keeps going look at this this is gigantic he gave us a tour of the company's Command Center where Engineers scrutinize and analyze every aspect of the company's operations on a 220 foot digital screen every facility in the Kingdom every drop of oil that comes from the ground is monitored in real time in this room in this room and we have control of each and every facility each and every pipeline each and every valve on the pipeline and therefore we know exactly what is happening in the system from A to Z what this map shows is all the oil fields in Saudi Arabia that big green blob in the middle is gawar the largest onshore oil field in the world and the one on top is safania the largest offshore oil field in the world and these green squares are super tankers that are being monitored on the high seas in real time so there's not anything that goes on with oil with Saudi Arabian oil that isn't known in this room absolutely absolutely how much did this facility cost you a lot of money and what you see today is a company that is as professionally sound as any International oil company before Ali al-naimi became oil Minister he ran Saudi aramco for 11 years he was the first Saudi president and CEO you have as you just said one of the most efficient Cutting Edge 21st century companies in the world yes within one of the most religious conservative countries in the world it's it's almost a paradox we were surprised by this I don't think there is any any really surprise many people have images of Saudi Arabia but they really change their views and images when they come and visit Saudi Arabia but to Western eyes it is a paradox skyscrapers traffic jams and shopping malls coexist with ancient tribal customs the king and the Koran reign supreme and women everywhere are required to cover themselves in Black from head to toe even I had to wear the Abaya the rules apply everywhere it seems except for the women at Saudi aramco when the U.S oil companies came here in the 40s and 50s the Americans moved into the area with their families and developed it to suit their tastes and their way of life they created a replica of American Suburbia today you could be in the outskirts of Houston or Los Angeles it's almost like an enclave within Saudi Arabia it's it's it's different from the rest of the country yes that's true because it's it kept a lot of the American ways yes of course there's nothing wrong with these are there are excellent ways but I was so surprised to see the culture there because for instance I saw men and women working side by side I saw women driving cars there which you don't see it's not strange not strange to him he's a product of that culture having risen through the ranks he started out as a 12 year old office boy in 1947 when it was said that to get oil all you needed to do was ladle it out of the sand it was never that easy according to aramco CEO Juma it takes a lot of effort the oil is a gift from God the recovery of oil is really the work of men and this is part of it here here in this room aramco Engineers are making sure that not one drop of oil is overlooked these computers are receiving data via satellite from sensors mounted on drill bits that are burrowing deep into the oil fields all over Saudi Arabia the engineers are sending IMS instant messages that actually guide the drill bits he is now directing that drill bit to go into the best areas of the reservoirs and suck that oil from it and not leave any oil behind so in other words this drill bits like a snake it doesn't go like that no it would go down and then follow with the oil absolutely and mind you this is happening 400 to 500 miles from here geographically and we are sending that drill bit also two or three miles in the ground aljuma says with this technology they're able to recover 10 times more oil than before but Global demand is dwindling even Americans the world's leading gas guzzlers are buying less than the last 10 months Americans drove 78 billion fewer miles than they did in the 10 months last year same 10 months this is quite a dramatic decrease in driving to put it in in better numbers I think your consumption dropped by a million battles is there a thinking that this decrease in demand might be permanent no no he says the u.s's Saudi Arabia's number one customer and the question is what will a ramco do to keep it that way one thing is discourage the move toward electric cars by trying to alleviate our concerns about the environment they showed us their new four million dollar experimental combustion engine which they hope will increase gas mileage while it lowers CO2 emissions what we want to see is that there is an emphasis on also making this oil greener and making the fossil fuels in general A Greener because they're going to be with us for the Long Haul let me be what yeah okay and ask you to be candid is it a ramco's hope to prevent a switch away from oil somebody said the country is the oil business I mean you absolutely need to do this for your own Survival and what's wrong with that well I didn't say anything was wrong with it but it's a fact you'd admit it's a fact yeah we had met a fact that yes this is uh we depend on the oil industry we wanted to help us you know to develop our economy and to develop the economy of the world so what is good for the well-being of Saudi Arabia should be good for the well-being of the world too so there's nothing wrong with that and so what do you say to people out there like Al Gore and and now Mr Obama that say we have to devote ourselves devote ourselves to to reducing our dependence on oil my answer to this is we have to be realistic we don't have the Alternatives today let's be my guest and come and bring them in but they are not there you're saying whatever the world does in terms of wind nuclear coal we're still going to need oil you're still in a lot of it to need oil and and a lot of it politicians use this all the time that we're addicted addicted to foreign oil and addiction has a dark connotation because if you're addicted there's a suggestion that there's a drug dealer who's trying to keep you hooked it's in the air that you want to keep us hooked there is nothing addictive about oil if you look back a hundred years what would the world be without it even President Bush was an oil man even he has said we're addicted to this and we have to get off this oil but listen to what the professionals say and what do they advise it's not going to happen today it's not going to happen 10 years from now it's probably not going to happen 20 years from now it's not going to happen 30 years from now okay because you are still going to be using fossil fuels rather than oil pushers the Saudis see themselves as good Global Citizens who are trying to save the world from a catastrophic oil shortage but as oil Minister al-naimi told us the kingdom is hedging its bets we in Saudi Arabia are developing solar energy solar energy yes you're doing research in solar energy yes what else is the solar energy the most intense the desert who knows that's of course but won't that hurt your oil industry no no no not at all it will supplement it our vision is that we will be exporters of gigawatts of electricity we will be exporting both okay and what was it battles of oil and gigawatts of power and so he says the kingdom will still be in the energy business long after the sun sets on the age of oil in 10 days President Obama will visit Saudi Arabia at a time of deep mistrust between the two allies and lingering doubts about the Saudi commitment to fighting violent Islamic extremism it also comes at a time when the White House and intelligence officials are reviewing whether to declassify one of the country's most sensitive documents known as the 28 Pages they have to do with 9 11 and the possible existence of a Saudi support network for the hijackers while they were in the U.S for 13 years the 28 Pages have been locked away in a secret vault only a small group of people have ever seen them tonight you'll hear from some of the people who have read them and believe along with the families of 9 11 victims that they should be Declassified I think it is implausible to believe that 19 people most of whom didn't speak English most of whom had never been in the United States before many of whom didn't have a high school education could have carried out such a complicated task without some support from within the United States and you believe that the 28 pages are crucial to this I think they are a key part former U.S senator Bob Graham has been trying to get the 28 Pages released since the day they were classified back in 2003 when he played a major role in the first government investigation into 9 11. I remain deeply disturbed by the amount of material that has been censored from this report at the time Graham was chairman of the Senate select committee on intelligence I called The Joint inquiry committee to order and co-chair of the bipartisan joint Congressional inquiry into intelligence failures surrounding the attacks The Joint inquiry reviewed a half a million documents interviewed hundreds of witnesses and produced an 838-page report minus the Final Chapter which was blanked out excised by the Bush Administration for reasons of national security so this is your office Bob Graham won't discuss the classified information in the 28 Pages he will say only that they outline a network of people that he believes supported the hijackers while they were in the U.S you believe that support came from Saudi Arabia substantially and when we say the Saudis you mean the government rich people in the country Charities all of the above Graham and others believe the Saudi role has been soft pedaled to protect a delicate relationship with a complicated Kingdom where the rulers royalty riches in religion are all deeply intertwined in its institutions committee will be in order Porter Goss who was Graham's Republican co-chairman on the house side of the joint inquiry it later director of the CIA also felt strongly that an uncensored version of the 28 pages should be included in the final report the two men made their case to the FBI and its then director Robert Mueller in a face-to-face meeting they pushed back very hard on the 28 pages and they said no that cannot be unclassified at this time did you happen to ask the FBI director why it was classified dead in a general way and the answer was because we said so when it needs to be classified Goss says he knew of no reason then and knows of no reason now why the pages need to be classified they are locked away under the Capitol in guarded vaults called sensitive compartmented information facilities or Skiffs in government jargon this is as close as we could get with our cameras a highly restricted area where members of congress with the proper clearances can read the documents under close supervision no note-taking allowed it's all got to go up here Steve Tim Romer a former Democratic congressman and U.S ambassador to India has read the 28 Pages multiple times first is a member of The Joint inquiry and later is a member of the Blue Ribbon 911 Commission which picked up where congress's investigation left off how hard is it to actually read these 28 Pages very hard these are tough documents to get your eyes on Romer and others who have actually read the 28 Pages describe them as a working draft similar to a grand jury or police report that includes provocative evidence some verified and some not they lay out the possibility of official Saudi assistance for two of the hijackers who settled in Southern California that information from the 28 Pages was turned over to the 911 Commission for further investigation some of the questions raised were answered in the commission's final report others were not is there information in the 28 pages that if they were Declassified would surprise people sure you're going to be surprised by it and uh you're going to be surprised by some of the answers that are sitting there today in the 911 Commission report about what happened in San Diego and what happened in Los Angeles and what was the Saudi involvement much of that surprising information is buried in footnotes and dependencies of the 911 report part of the official public record but most of it unknown to the General Public these are some but not all of the facts in January of 2000 the first of the hijackers landed in Los Angeles after attending an Al-Qaeda Summit in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia the two Saudi Nationals nawaf al-hazmi and Khalid all midar arrived with extremely limited language skills and no experience with Western culture yet through an incredible series of circumstances they managed to get everything they needed from housing to flight lessons La San Diego that's really you know the Hornet's Nest that's really the one that I continue to think about almost on a daily basis during their first days in La Witnesses placed the two future hijackers at the king fod mosque in the company of Fahad all through Mary a diplomat at the Saudi consulate known to hold extremist views later 9 11 investigators would find him deceptive and suspicious and in 2003 he would be denied re-entry to the United States for having suspected ties to terrorist activity this is a very interesting person in the whole 911 episode of who might have helped whom in Los Angeles and San Diego with two terrorists who didn't know their way around phone records show that tumeri was also in regular contact with this man Omar all bayumi a mysterious Saudi who became the hijacker's biggest benefactor he was a ghost employee with the no-show job at a Saudi Aviation contractor outside Los Angeles while drawing a paycheck from the Saudi government you believe biome was a Saudi agent yes what makes you believe that well for one thing he'd been listed even before 9 11 in FBI files as being a Saudi agent on the morning of February 1st 2000 bayumi went to the office of the Saudi consulate where thumeri worked he then proceeded to have lunch at a middle eastern restaurant on Venice Boulevard where he later claimed he just happened to make the acquaintance of the two future hijackers hosmia medhar magically run into Miami in a restaurant that Naomi claims is a coincidence and one of the biggest cities in the United States and he decides to befriend them he decides to not only befriend them but then to help them move to San Diego and get residents in San Diego bayumi found them a place to live in his own apartment complex Advanced them the security deposit and co-signed the lease he even threw them a party and introduced them to other Muslims who would help the hijackers obtain government IDs and enroll in English classes and flight schools there's no evidence that bayumi orthumeri knew what the future hijackers were up to and it is possible that they were just trying to help fellow Muslims but the very dayumi welcomed the hijackers to San Diego there were four calls between his cell phone and the Imam at a San Diego mosque Anwar al-alaki a name that should sound familiar America cannot and will not win the american-born al-laki would be Infamous a decade later as Al qaeda's Chief propagandist and top operative in Yemen until he was taken out by a CIA drone but in January 2001 a year after becoming the hijackers spiritual advisor he left San Diego for Falls Church Virginia months later hosmi midar and three more hijackers would join him there those are a lot of acquincidences and that's a lot of smoke is that enough to make you squirm and uncomfortable and dig harder and declassify these 28 Pages absolutely perhaps no one is more interested in reading the 28 Pages than attorneys Jim kreiner and Sean Carter who represent family members of the 9 11 victims in their lawsuit against the kingdom alleging that its institutions provided money to Al Qaeda knowing that it was Waging War against the United States what we're doing in court is is developing the story that has to come out but it's been difficult for us because for many years we weren't getting the kind of openness and cooperation that that we think our government owes to the American people particularly the the families the people who are murdered the U.S government is even backed the Saudi position in court that it can't be sued because it enjoys sovereign immunity the 911 Commission report says that Saudi Arabia has long been considered the primary source of Al Qaeda funding through its wealthy citizens and Charities with significant government sponsorship but the sentence that got the most attention when the report came out is this we have found no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded the organization attorney Sean Carter says it's the most carefully crafted line in the 911 Commission report and the most misunderstood when they say that we found no evidence that senior Saudi officials individually funded Al Qaeda they conspicuously leave open the potential that they found evidence that people who were officials that they did not regard as senior officials had done so that is the essence of the family's lawsuit that elements of the government and lower level officials sympathetic to Bin Laden's cause helped Al Qaeda carry out the attacks and help sustain the al-Qaeda Network yet for more than a decade the kingdom is maintained at that one sentence exonerated it of any responsibility for 9 11. regardless of what might be in the 28 Pages it's not an exoneration but we said we did not with this report exonerate the Saudis former U.S senator Bob Carey is another of the 10-member 911 Commission who has read the 28 pages and believes they should be Declassified he filed an affidavit in support of the 911 families lawsuit you can't provide the money for terrorists and then say I don't have anything to do with what they were doing do you believe that all of the leads that were developed in the 28 Pages were answered in the 911 report all the questions no in general the 911 Commission did not get every single detail of the conspiracy we didn't we didn't have the time we didn't have the resources and we certainly didn't pursue the entire line of inquiry in regards Saudi Arabia do you think all of these things in San Diego can be explained as coincidence I don't believe in coincidences John Layman who was Secretary of the Navy in the Reagan Administration says that he and the others make up a solid majority of former 911 Commissioners who think the 28 pages should be made public we're not a bunch of roofs that rode into Washington for this commission I mean you know we've seen fire and we've seen rain in in the politics of National Security we all have dealt for our careers in highly classified and compartmentalized in every aspect of security we know when something shouldn't be Declassified and the this those 28 pages in no way fall into that category Layman has no doubt that some high Saudi officials knew that assistance was being provided to Al Qaeda but he doesn't think it was ever official policy he also doesn't think that it absolves the Saudis of responsibility it was no accident that 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis they all went to Saudi schools they learned from the time they were first able to go to school of this intolerant brand of Islam Lehman is talking about wahhabism the ultra-conservative puritanical form of Islam that's rooted here and permeates every facet of society there is no separation of church and state after oil wahhabism is one of the Kingdom's biggest exports Saudi clerics entrusted with Islam's holiest shrines have immense power and billions of dollars to spread the faith building mosques in religious schools all over the world that have become recruiting grounds for violent extremists 9 11 commissioner John Layman says all of this comes across in the 28 Pages this is not going to be a Smoking Gun that is going to to cause a huge fuhrer but it does give a very compact illustration of the kinds of things that went on that would really help the American people to understand how is it that these people are springing up all over the world to go to Jihad look the Saudis have even said therefore declassifying it we should declassify it is it sensitive Steve might it involve opening a bit of can of worms or some snakes crawling out of there yes but I think we need a relationship with the Saudis where both countries are working together to fight against terrorism and that's not always been the case in the days of the Roman Coliseum they called it bread and circuses leaders using The Superficial appeal of entertainment to distract citizens from genuine problems the term today sportswashing the use of games and teams and stadiums to cleanse an image and launder a reputation a country that has never won an Olympic gold medal Saudi Arabia has suddenly emerged as a major player in global sport hosting events spying teams and luring athletes with staggering contracts is this investment an attempt to diversify the economy and cater to younger citizens as its leaders claim or is it done to paper over human rights abuses authoritarian Rule and even murder we visited the kingdom to check out the sports World's new nerve center then check out what the Saudis and their neighbors are getting for their money Argentina

heavyweight title fight a few months later the kingdom staged the world's richest horse race [Music] [Applause] there's Formula One racing and a 10-year deal with the WWE [Applause] but to many these Mega events in Saudi Arabia are Financial loss leaders being used to launder the image of a country while cloaking repression and authoritarian rule you've heard this term Sports washing this idea that countries can cover up bad Acts through sports do you believe in the concept that a country can use Sports this way not at all I don't agree with that with that term because I think that if you go to different parts of the world then you bring people together everyone should come see Saudi Arabia see it for what it is and then make your decision see it for yourself if you don't like it fine which is precisely why we came to Saudi Arabia late last year to see this unlikely Sports Hub for ourselves December is the off season for pro tennis yet Riyadh was the site of an exhibition studded with top 10 stars and embroidered with local touches Falcons enlisted to help with the draw ceremony but the real draw Australia's Nick curios was blunt what's brought you here at the end well money's pretty good I'm not gonna lie despite deserts of empty seats and little in the way of Television rights usually the lifeblood for sports the players were paid Millions just to show up magnificent in tiller Fritz a Californian earned a million dollars in prize money for winning the weekend event the Saudis aren't just hosting events through the Kingdom's Sovereign wealth fund they bought an English Premier League soccer team Newcastle United we saw them for a visiting game against the local team pointedly abandoning their usual striped kits were the green of the Saudi flag then there is to date saudi's biggest swing in sports the 2.5 billion dollar live tour which has divided golf dismissing this rival to the PGA Tour as quote an endless pit of money Tiger Woods turned down 800 million dollars from the Saudis to join live many other top players including Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson did switch their tour allegiances both paid as they were north of a hundred million dollars this flood of Saudi money into sports is just absolutely it's a disrupter it's completely changing the face of sports is is that the intention not at all it adds a lot to the sport you have to realize the impact this has and when winners of live golf events are making multiple times what Tiger Woods won the last time he won the Masters that's a big economic change it doesn't matter I think if the impact of increasing the participation of sports and the interest in that sport is growing then why not the sports Minister insists that the massive investment is an essential pillar of what is called Vision 2030 a 7 trillion dollar plan by the Kingdom's effective ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman or MBS to diversify the economy Beyond oil while softening some of its most restrictive

political repression in Saudi Arabia has become more severe you're saying this is window dressing this is this is cosmetic and behind the games there's Mass executions and repression like never before absolutely exactly this is what's happening the cultural shift goes beyond Sports who would have pegged Saudi Arabia to start hosting an annual desert raid Bruno Mars and DJ Khaled were among the headliners it's all of a piece Sports entertainment tourism to marry it all the Crown Prince turned to American impresario jarion zarillo what's the guy from Brooklyn doing in a place like this creating magic making a place welcoming for everybody to come see the kingdom the birthplace of the Kingdom very exciting times in his career in hospitality and entertainment in zarillo launched Atlantis in the Bahamas name a global celebrity and be assured Jerry has made their acquaintance I've done five decades in tourism my job is to welcome people and to create joy and festivity with vision 2030 now we want people to come to Saudi today he oversees a massive 63 billion dollar development on the site where the Saudi state was born converting it into a modern Xanadu with homes for a

the one in brung you who bring you who brung me here yeah Vision 2030 a very benevolent very love king and a very Visionary Dynamic Crown Prince but it's the less noble doings of the Crown Prince that have stained the country's reputation but with accelerating and complicating its foray into sports a CIA report said MBS approved the 2018 assassination and dismembering of Washington Post journalist Jamel khashoggi under mbs's rule executions have drastically increased including a mass beheading of 81 people in one day last March the mildest criticism of the state even on Twitter has been met with detention torture and long and arbitrary prism sentences we've heard a lot about transition we've seen it with our own eyes but the concern is that this country right now is still not fit to hold International sporting events we're not saying that we're perfect but what I'm trying to say is that these things help us to achieve a better future for our population I think no country would say they're perfect but are you saying that every country has a leader that according to the CIA has ordered the murder of a journalist are you saying that every country has 81 beheadings at a single day and if the answer is no doesn't it make this relative argument this what about Islam doesn't it make that irrelevant well what I'm trying to say is that let's look at the good side about this and and you know you're just pinpointing certain topics that if we I go and you know we had the mass shooting a couple of weeks ago in the US does that mean that we don't host the the World Cup in the US no we should go to the us we should get people together mass shooting is not a government actor let's be clear about it still whatever whatever people died but what I'm trying to say is that if we look at only the bad side then we shouldn't do anything are there not Universal so they're not basic thresholds you think need to be met as I said there's a lot of issues with a lot of countries but then you mentioned that the order came from the conference and that's not true there's no proof of that as we speak you're denying that the cia's report that says I don't think there's a report actually says that if you look at it the CIA report concluded Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman approved an operation to capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal khashoggi finally they Collide still the games go on so do the choices just last month FIFA soccer's governing body not known for occupying ethical High Ground responded to protests from players and turned down Saudi tourism sponsorship offer for this Summer's Women's World Cup these moral dilemmas will only intensify when we were in Saudi Arabia we saw a top-level tennis event a top-level golf event had just been held Bruno Mars had given a concert what would your message be to the athletes and entertainers who are coming in to perform and compete my message is that why would you go to Saudi Saudi Arabia and going on the ground to speak on behalf of the prisoners who have been muzzled on all the families that cannot speak because when you go to Saudi Arabia you are part of of discovering up machine what do you think the purpose is of throwing around billions and billions of dollars into sports like this I think the the Saudi government decided regime and MBS he wants people to think of Ronaldo when they think about Saudi and not about that's become the association now we've gone from the murder journalist to the star soccer player absolutely unfortunately,"The transcript is an extensive discussion on Saudi Arabia's vast investments in the sports world, which many critics argue serve as efforts of sportswashing to distract from human rights abuses within the Kingdom. Saudi Arabia has significantly invested in becoming a major player in global sports, hosting events, and attracting star athletes like Cristiano Ronaldo with substantial contracts. Despite the massive influx of capital into sports, the country faces criticism for using this strategy to cleanse its image amid allegations of human rights violations, repression, and authoritarian rule. The transcript covers the juxtaposition of newfound social freedoms, like women being allowed to drive, against a backdrop of severe political repression, including the crackdown on activists and the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The strategy is part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 to diversify the economy, which also involves tourism and entertainment. Critics emphasize that the positive changes don't obscure the reality of state-led abuses, calling on sports figures to speak out against these injustices. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince and officials deny allegations of wrongdoing, maintaining that investment in sports and other sectors aims to foster a better future for the population.",Sportswashing,-1,No,Newcastle United ownership,Saudi Arabia
YCMIwOvegak,Why Saudi Arabia’s economy needs sport,"This is St James’x Park, home of English
Premier League football club Newcastle United, a club that until recently had suffered
decades of disappointment. Now, for the first time in 20 years,
Newcastle fans will be watching their team in the Champions League,
Europe’s top tier competition. Breathtaking...I can’t...no words. This is what we’ve been waiting for man,
it's an absolute dream! I think it’s fantastic! Newcastle’s recent success has
less to do with the northeast of England and more to do with their new owners,
Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and their deep pockets. And football is not the only professional
sport that Saudi Arabia is investing in. Saudi Arabia is the world’s top oil exporter
and second-largest producer behind the United States. Its vast oil and gas resources have made it
the world’s 17th largest economy. So why does it need this
massive investment in sport? Saudi Arabia is heavily reliant on oil revenues,
which, despite efforts to diversify the economy, still account for a sizeable portion of its GDP. This is significantly affected
by fluctuations in oil prices. According to the IMF, oil revenues averaged
75% of total Saudi budget revenues between 2010 and 2021, but varied from
a 93% peak in 2011 to just 53% in 2020, as the Covid-19 pandemic
depressed global oil demand. With the world transitioning away
from its reliance on fossil fuels and towards more sustainable energy sources,
Saudi Arabia needs to find other long-term sources of revenue, and
Vision 2030 hopes to lay the groundwork for leisure, tourism and entertainment
to shoulder much of the burden. I think the investment in sport and
how that serves to launder an image is an inextricable part of Saudi Arabia's foreign policy,
its commercial policy and its economic policy. But will the Kingdom get a return on its investment? England’s Premier League is the
most-watched football league in the world, boasting some of the sport’s biggest clubs
and best known stars — and racking up billions of global viewers every year. I was brought up a Manchester City fan. We were dismal. Then in 2008, the club was bought by
the Abu Dhabi United Group, an investment vehicle for the Abu Dhabi royal family. Over the next 15 years, City went from this: to this: In 2008, Manchester City became the
first major club to be purchased by owners with ties to a Gulf state. Today, Abu Dhabi’s City Football Group owns
more than 10 clubs across 4 continents. Abu Dhabi’s venture paved the way for other Gulf states
looking to expand their global influence, as demonstrated by the two teams
playing in the Champions League: Saudi-owned Newcastle United and
Paris Saint-Germain, owned by Qatar Sports Investments. Let's be honest, the two countries are not
on the best of terms than anything else, and we often say that sport is war without guns,
and that was one way of making a declaration in favor of Saudi Arabia. According to an EY study, football contributed
around $9 billion to the U.K. economy over the course of the 2019/20 season. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in
a media interview suggested that he had already secured 1% growth in GDP from sports
and was aiming for another 1.5%. If sportswashing was going to increase
economic growth, he said, then Saudi Arabia will “continue to do sportswashing.” In 2022, Saudi GDP was $1.1 trillion, so in
order for sports to increase its GDP by 1%, it would already need to be pouring around
$11 billion into Riyadh’s coffers. I think the GDP claims were optimistic. You've only got to look at what's happening
in the Saudi Pro League in terms of the average attendances, we've had matches
in the last weekend as low as 200 people going to the match, so I don't see the GDP claim
as being one which really proves itself once you start to do any form of forensic analysis. Even though the Saudi economy
grew 8.7% in  2022, things are not looking so rosy in 2023. The IMF expects growth to decelerate to 1.9%,
while many economists see it slipping into contraction. The government’s own forecasts
suggest a return to a budget deficit. Unemployment was 8.3% in the
second quarter of 2023, though economists believe the true figure
could be much higher. In recent years, the government
has given handouts to its population in the absence of the commercial infrastructure
that would yield sufficient jobs. While the majority of foreigners hold
private sector jobs, economists estimate that around two-thirds of
employed Saudis work for the state. Ideally, the government would like to transition
to a more self-sustaining economy. It's far more to do with domestic acceptance
and proving to his citizens that he can deliver Neymar, Ronaldo, Benzema and other global names. And if he can do that across a variety of sports,
then any fears of the equivalent of an Arab Spring rising that we saw in the
likes of Libya and Egypt a few years ago, they're likely to be dissipated, because
what have people got to protest about if they are seeing the entertainment that they crave. Reforms and state-led investment
have seen the non-oil sector’s contribution to Saudi GDP rise to 44% in 2022,
just 0.7 percentage points higher than it was in 2016. So while not impossible, it may take much longer
than MBS suggests for the deluge of sporting investment to come to fruition. Stephen Cockburn is the head of economic
and social justice at Amnesty International. He’s also a lifelong supporter of Newcastle United. I think it's likely that there is a cultural
and a sort of PR return on investment. I think it's such a, in sport and especially football,
such a huge cultural asset with reach all over the world, then it is a canny investment for states that
would like to show itself in a different light  and appeal to different
audiences around the world. It will never receive a financial
return on investment. I cannot see a position in which fans of football
around the world, their first choice will be the Saudi Pro League as opposed to la Liga,
Bundesliga, Premier League and so on. And that's partly due to the fact that, historically, football fans
have been very intransigent, with regards to their loyalties. But the Middle Eastern investment in football
hasn’t stopped with buying clubs. Qatar hosted the World Cup in 2022,
while the Saudi Pro League spent around $1 billion in the summer of 2023
luring some of the world’s best known players to its domestic clubs. In June, the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia
took control of four of the country’s leading clubs: Al Ittihad, Al Hilal, Al Ahli and Al Nassr, as part of
the government’s “Vision 2030” project  to attract investment in its domestic sports sector. And then there’s golf, Formula 1, boxing,
tennis, wrestling — the list goes on. The speed and scale of the investment has
garnered global attention. But the debate extends far beyond the money, or the
upheaval of the traditional sporting power structures. So, why is Saudi Arabia’s investment in
sport so controversial? Saudi Arabia has a well-documented history
of human rights abuses, which has prompted critics to chalk its bankrolling of big name
sporting events and teams up to ‘sportswashing,’ an effort to launder its global reputation
and divert attention away from a dire record on human rights. For the last few years, we've had record executions,
minors on death row, we've had record sentences, prison sentences for human rights activists. A woman, a Leeds University student, sentenced
to 34 years in prison for sending a tweet. We've got exploitation of migrant workers,
and we've got really serious, serious repression. So there's many, many Newcastle fans who of
course support the club, but are really really concerned about the actions of the ownership. It needs investment, it needs
tourism to diversify from oil. What we've seen over the last few years
is an enormous investment in sport and that is all part of a strategy to
rehabilitate the kingdom's image. Danny Spraggon held a season ticket 
at St James’s Park for 30 years. He’s recently handed it back, and become
a vocal member of the protest group NUFC Fans Against Sportswashing. I think like many fans, I'd be lying if I said
there wasn't part of me who wasn't very excited to suddenly become the richest club
in world club football. I don't think anyone wouldn't be. But I quickly decided going to the match that
I couldn't take part in all the excitement. Do you feel like that voice is being heard,
and what’s the ultimate aim for the group as far as taking it beyond protest? I think what we're trying to do is speak to
people in Saudi Arabia whose lives are impacted by the oppressive regime
and trying to raise these questions at the club level because nobody else is. And you talked about the antagonistic reaction
in some cases, what sort of objections do you mostly face? I think there are probably lots of contradictions
in what we're doing, but that doesn't take away your right to protest about the club
that you identify as a fan with, and that you feel part of. I feel this is my football club
more than it is the Saudi PIF’s. Yet, defenders of Saudi Arabia may contend
that there is an element of hypocrisy here. A lot of the criticism has come from individuals
and organizations based in countries that are happy to maintain close economic ties with 
Riyadh, to buy its oil, and to sell it their arms. The U.K., for example, sold more than $1 billion
of arms to Saudi Arabia in 2022. The Premier League has always welcomed investment
from anybody that has a large bank account, and it's not tended to worry too much. And I think you've also got to be a little
bit careful that we don't move into a slightly xenophobic regime, in the sense that there
are many things about the United States with regards to its domestic policies
across a variety of social issues, which would appear to be at odds
with even what we consider to be appropriate here in the UK. And yet, nobody's saying that an American
owner should not come into the game. While the global sports industry is being
transformed by Riyadh's investments, could the need for international appeal become a
catalyst for change in the conservative country? Does that happen?
Does that ever happen? I mean, you look at them. China had the Beijing Olympics, and has their
record improved? Same with Russia and the Winter Olympics. We always say that sportswashing only really
works if we stop talking about it. It does mean that sports bodies, whether that's
a Premier League, whether that's FIFA,  need to get serious about the role of states in
our game, to protect the integrity of the game in terms of competitive balance and fairness,
but also to make sure it can't be associated with, or can't assist, human rights abuses.","The transcript delves into the impact of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund buying Newcastle United and its broader investments in sports, including football, golf, boxing, and more. These investments are framed within Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, aimed at diversifying its economy away from oil dependency. The document discusses Saudi Arabia's ambitions to use sports as a tool for economic growth and international image laundering, known as ""sportswashing."" It highlights Saudi Arabia's human rights issues, such as record executions and repression, as causes for criticism against their sports investments. The discussion reflects on whether these initiatives will yield financial and social returns and examines the contradictions and hypocrisy surrounding global economic relations with Saudi Arabia. Criticism also comes from local fans and groups, yet there's acknowledgment of the duality in welcoming new investments while scrutinizing their ethical implications. The debate extends to whether international appeal through sports can influence domestic change in Saudi Arabia, comparing it to other countries like China and Russia, which hosted major sporting events without improving human rights records.",Sportswashing,-1,No,Newcastle United ownership,Saudi Arabia

The discussion highlights Saudi acquisitions such as Newcastle United and potential interests in other sports franchises and events, framing these moves as part of a broader strategy to alter global perceptions of Saudi Arabia from an ultra-conservative state to a dynamic, sports-focused nation.

Z_3t4Me-USY,Why Saudi Arabia is Investing Billions in Sport,foreign [Applause] on October 7th 2021 Newcastle United Football Club were sold for a reported 408 million dollars making them the richest Club in World football most of the money behind the deal came from Saudi Arabia's public investment fund which is valued at over 600 billion dollars and Newcastle weren't the only beneficiaries across the sporting World money from the fund was being used to invest in major sporting series host major events and even purchase established groups within sectors but these Investments haven't been without controversy various human rights groups have objected to all the investment accusing the Gulf State of using sport to wash over allegations of Human Rights abuses in recent years it's a complex picture so why are Saudi Arabia investing so much into World Sport and why have their Investments proven so controversial this is the story of Saudi Arabia's attempt to Own World sport [Music] Dory doesn't begin with sport in fact the story really starts in 1933 when the Saudi Arabian government signed an oil concession agreement with Standard Oil company which led to the development of oil fields in the country in 1960 OPEC was created with Saudi Arabia being one of the founding members but it was during the 1973 oil crisis when the Saudi economy really began to accelerate with some estimates suggesting that it grew from 15 billion dollars in 1973 to 184 billion dollars by 1981. this created a dependence on oil and since the 1970s the Saudi Arabian government has been looking at ways to diversify their economy the country still holds approximately 16 percent of the world's petroleum reserves and so oil is still the driver of their economic engine but with reserves running down and oil prices fluctuating the need to accelerate towards a more robust economy has intensified [Music] this led to the announcement of Saudi Vision 2030 by Mohammed bin Salman in April 2016. the vision was a strategic framework aimed at reducing dependence on oil diversifying the economy increasing non-oil trade and investment and developing Public Service sectors to promote a more secular image of the nation the strategy was laid out around three main pillars a vibrant Society a thriving economy and an ambitious Nation with the development largely funded by the public investment fund or pif the state's Sovereign wealth fund which houses estimated assets of 620 billion dollars clearly Vision 2030 is a strategic vision for Saudi Arabia as a whole but investing in sport both nationally and globally has been marked as a key part of the plan the official plan even says we aspire to excel in sport and be among the leaders in selected Sports regionally and globally given the reach popularity and Economic Opportunity provided by sport on a global scale it's no surprise that sporting investment became a significant part of the diversification Plan before Vision 2030 Saudi Arabia sport interests had been minimal there had been investment from The Wider region most notably the takeovers of PSG and Man City but Saudi Arabia had not entered the sporting scene on a large scale but that was about to change and fast as of 2021 Saudi Arabia had already spent more than 2.2 billion dollars since 2017 and when you add in the money they've committed for future events and Ventures that figure Rises to at least 7.2 billion dollars and even this is probably an underestimate given the number of Investments with undisclosed fees this has spanned a whole range of sports but perhaps the two most notable Investments have been the Takeover of Premier League Football Club Newcastle United and the backing of the Breakaway Golf League live golf with Newcastle Saudi Arabia's public investment fund led a Consortium fronted by Amanda stavely to purchase the club for 409 million dollars with the pif acting as the majority owner of the group holding an 80 share of the club and with the Takeover of the club the governor of the pifman who also happens to be chairman of state-owned oil company aramco became the chairman of Newcastle II overnight Newcastle became the wealthiest Club in World football with assets worth approximately 320 billion pounds only Cutter's investment Authority which owns Paris saint-german and has assets worth around 220 billion pounds comes anywhere close to their levels of financial backing and since the purchase Newcastle spending in the transfer market has increased dramatically going up 234 percent compared to the previous season with 150 million dollars spent since the start of last season alone given the success that Manchester City have had since they were bought by Sheikh Mansour in 2008 there's clearly an expectation that Newcastle could follow a similar route to Premier League success away from football the other high-profile investment has come on the golf course with the backing of live golf Investments which is pioneering the Breakaway live golf series the series itself is causing schisms within the golfing world as high-profile players such as Phil Mickelson Dustin Johnson Cameron Smith and Brooks koepka have all joined the series and subsequently been banned from competing in sanctioned PGA Tour events the pif is estimated to have committed over 3 billion dollars to the series over the next few years as part of plans to hold 14 events every year and offer players extremely lucrative contracts to lure them away from the traditional PGA Tour as with Newcastle this doesn't seem to be a short-term bet with plans stretching decades into the future according to Greg Norman the CEO of live but the Investments don't stop at Newcastle and live money has been poured into a whole host of other sports and events too these Investments include a deal worth approximately one billion dollars over 10 years with the WWE which we'll see at least two events per year held in Saudi Arabia a 10-year deal with formula one worth 650 million dollars which will see the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix at the Jetta circuit cemented in the F1 calendar for at least the next 10 years this comes on top of a 10-year sponsorship deal worth 450 million dollars between Formula One and aramco the state-owned oil company on top of this the country outbid other venues to host high-profile boxing events including the recent heavyweight rematch between Anthony Joshua and Alexander usick which reportedly cost around 80 million dollars and came on top of the 60 million dollars the country paid in December 2019. to host Joshua's rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr the kingdom equally has Grand plans for the growing Esports sector after launching a new gaming group in January 2022 they acquired ESL gaming one of the largest independent esport entities in the world from sweden-based Modern Times group in an all-cash transaction of 1.05 billion dollars they then bought faceit one of the biggest tournament organizers in Esports for 500 million dollars and merged the two companies to form the ESL faceit Group which will act as the foundation stone to realize their targets in the sector and the investments in sporting projects show no sign of slowing down either the country has already hired american-based Boston Consulting Group to look into hosting the football World Cup in 2030 or 2034 and they see hosting the Olympics as the ultimate goal Sports Minister Prince Abdul Aziz bin turkey al-faisal is reported to have said we're open to discuss with the ioc about this for the future I think Saudi Arabia has showcased that we can host such events definitely the Olympics would be an ultimate goal for us we're open to that and I think we can thank you but while hosting the Olympics is an admirable goal for any country there are some who think the recent investment and involvement in global sport has other motives for some people the vast sums of money being poured into Global sport is not an attempt to develop but rather part of a wider strategy aimed at improving the country's image and soft power status on an international stage also known as Sports washing Sports washing is a relatively new term but the practice has been around since the start of the 20th century there are various definitions but it's essentially when a group Corporation or nation state uses sport to improve its reputation and Public Image through hosting prestigious sporting events or investing and financing popular teams the idea being that the focus on the unifying and positive aspects of sport will detract from or cover up other problems that the country might be facing more recently the Winter Olympics in Russia and China plus the World Cups in Russia and Qatar have all faced similar accusations relating to sports washing for Saudi Arabia the country has been accused of trying to use sport as a means to cover for human rights violations and international controversies that have embroiled the nation-state in recent years these include the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal khashoggi in 2017 who was killed after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul the ongoing war in Yemen which has claimed the lives of approximately 377 000 people as well as other human rights violations including the oppression of women and lgbtq plus groups and alleged torture of political prisoners and discrimination towards certain religious groups with this context human rights groups have come out against a number of the Investments most notably the Takeover of Newcastle Sasha Deshmukh Amnesty International UK CEO described the Takeover as a clear attempt by the Saudi authorities to sportswash their appalling human rights record with the glamor of Top Flight football Amanda stavely the British businesswoman who helped finalize the Takeover insists that the pif is an autonomous commercially driven investment fund which is not part of the wider state but given that Mohammed bin Salman sits as both the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and chairman of the public investment fund it's clear why some groups are concerned similar accusations have been made towards live golf with many advocacy groups accusing players of sportswashing Human Rights atrocities by signing up to the league most players have shied away from commenting but Greg Norman CEO of live golf is the exception to that rule insisting that he does not answer to Saudi Arabia and that they are not his bosses describing live golf Investments as independent to the pif it's impossible for us to know the true extent of the Saudi involvement in live golf but by providing over 3 billion dollars in funding from a financial perspective it's hard to deny the pif has played a significant role in the realization of the fledgling golf series but from a Saudi Arabian perspective the Investments are simply part of the vision 2030 plan Sports Minister Prince Abdul Aziz binturki al-faiso insisted that the country is progressing towards a better Society a better quality of life and that hosting these events benefit our people and benefit these changes that are happening and benefits living in Saudi but advocacy groups are still skeptical of the true purpose of the Investments and are lobbying for more athletes to speak out many athletes have been reluctant to comment but a few have expressed concern such as Lewis Hamilton who said Formula One drivers are Duty bound to try and raise awareness of issues in Saudi Arabia he said it's not necessarily our responsibility that we're brought here but we try and we do what we can and I think it's important that we just try to educate ourselves ultimately it's the responsibility of those in power to really make changes and we're not really seeing any so we need to see more it's clearly a controversial and contentious subject but why should sport be singled out Saudi Arabia have also invested billions of dollars into American companies like Amazon Microsoft Twitter Uber alphabet JPMorgan Chase and Company and many others and so sport is not unique in receiving funds from the Gulf State but sport is a global industry and the influence and soft power that comes with bankrolling a series like live golf or owning an asset like Newcastle United cannot be underestimated Sport and politics have always had a complex relationship and Saudi Arabia's drive to make sport a pillar of its Vision 2030 plan seems to be the next chapter in that controversial book [Music],"The transcript discusses Saudi Arabia's strategic investments in global sports, focusing on their acquisition of Newcastle United Football Club and their involvement in ventures like the LIV Golf series and hosting events like the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix and high-profile boxing matches. The investments are part of the Saudi Vision 2030, a plan to diversify the economy and reduce reliance on oil revenues. However, these investments are widely seen as a form of sportswashing, where Saudi Arabia is accused of improving its international image and soft power while downplaying serious human rights violations, including the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and women's and LGBTQ+ rights issues.

Despite this, Saudi officials maintain that these efforts are aimed at improving the nation's quality of life and societal development.

around 80 million euros to acquire 100 percent of PSG shares and had to stump up around 39 million just to cover the club's debt and financial losses from the previous season PSG value has multiplied Eightfold in the year since and in 2017 they had the seventh highest revenue in world football ahead of arsenal liverpool and Juventus and that's no wonder given that their parent company is owned by the Emir of Qatar himself Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-thani whose net worth is estimated at around 2 billion dollars his role as the ruler of Qatar means that he can simply handle a Parisien huge commercial contracts to enable their spending with a guitar tourism authority alone giving the team around 200 million euros a year as a result PSG have spent over 1 billion euros in transfer fees since the takeover including a world record 222 million on Neymar but they're already overdue for their five-year target bringing the Champions League trophy to the pop de France 9 Persepolis Iranian champions in the last two seasons Persepolis have been around for more than 50 years and are officially the most popular club in Asia their stadium holds 78,000 people around the same as Real Madrid Santiago bernabéu and their rivalry with another tehran club esta gal is iran's version of el clásico reportedly 10 of the 16 clubs in the Persian Gulf Pro League or state-owned and Persepolis are no exception with the Ministry of Youth Affairs and sports having control of the team however the lack of money from investors means that Persepolis have been in debts for years despite producing several high profile players like ali karimi and ali dire who both won the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich there are advantages to state patronage though with the government giving Persepolis to training grounds for their Academy and even opening restaurants and the university named after the team which specializes in sports offering degrees in subjects like math commentary and futsal kochi 8 beijing go on with twice the population of europe it's high time that china has started to leverage its manpower into becoming a major player in football the Chinese Super League has started to flex its muscles in recent years and Beijing gone have been that the vanguard of the divisions growth whoring former labor coos and coach Roger Schmidt and making Cedric McCann booth the most expensive African player ever gone have won the league just once in 2009 but are owned by the CIT IC Group an investment company belonging to the Chinese government and they like the rest of the league are benefiting from a new TV deal China sports media now pay around a hundred and eighty eight million dollars a year for the rights to show CSL matches a huge increase on the nine million dollars they paid back in 2015 as a result clubs are able to compete with European size for top talent rather than simply picking up old stars like the MLS that means go and have signed not just by kambou but also Spanish playmaker Jonathan Vieira beating Premier League club Swansea to the attacker China may not overtake Europe's elite anytime soon but for the continent smaller sides it may be time to start worrying seven and six Barcelona and Real Madrid no we're not talking about Barcelona's shady association with a Qatar Foundation a relationship which saw the club pocket 35 million a year in shirt sponsorship and parcel legends like javi and Pep Guardiola back the nation's World Cup bid instead both Barcelona and Real Madrid as well as five other clubs were given an unfair advantage by the Spanish government according to an EU investigation in 2016 governments within the EU are forbidden from using public money to help clubs but four of the teams involved including both clásico sides were charged the tax rate for charities rather than businesses for more than 20 years others like Valencia and Hercules who were in danger of going bankrupt received loans with discounted rates of interest after the government intervened on their behalf and Real Madrid who bought land from the state to build a new training ground in 1998 were found to have paid 15 million pounds less than the market value for the property essentially meaning they could pump that into their galactic Oh filled squad instead of spending it on facilities in the end Barcelona Raya Valencia Athletic Club Osasuna el share and Hercules were all ordered to pay back money which they had obtained or kept hold of legally with Valencia owing the most at around 17 million pounds but the damage was arguably already done with the three biggest clubs benefiting from the arrangement when he eighteen of the last twenty Spanish titles five CSKA Moscow the first of two Russian sides now with CSKA Moscow the oldest club in the country and one of the most successful with 13 national titles CSKA unnamed the military ins having been founded in 1911 as the official football team of the Russian army while city rivals Dynamo with the club of the police and Spartak would consider the club of the people now a professional side CSKA are still part owned by the Ministry of Defense and their success in Europe has been a source of Russian pride with a Europa League triumph in 2005 and the visits of the Champions League quarter-finals in 2010 however it is not the army but Roman Abramovich they have to thank for their success with his all company sibneft sponsoring the team until 2006 when they merge with Gazprom and began to back ZENIT's as owner of Chelsea you wafer would not allow Abramovich to actually hold any shares in CSKA but with 20 of the club's 32 major trophies coming after the year 2000 is clear that Roman succeeded where the army had failed for Zenit Saint Petersburg CSK may have the backing of the Russian army but as we just said Zenit Saint Petersburg is bankrolled by Gazprom which is the largest natural gas company in the world and is also majority owned by the Russian government the club was originally formed by workers at the Leningrad steel factory but in 2005 Gazprom took a controlling share in the team they had sponsored for the previous six years and financed a new stadium as well as investing over a hundred million dollars in the squad six years later Zenit won the second title in their history and their first in 23 seasons they have since added another three and have not finished outside the top five for the duration of Gazprom's time at the helm senate's managers have included Roberto Mancini Luciano Spalletti and Andre villas-boas and the club has attracted stars like Hulk and axel Witsel with five of the six most expensive players in the history of the Russian Premier League being Zenit purchases and not content to restrict their influence to their homeland Gazprom now sponsor Chelsea Schalke Red Star and the Champions League forming a new Russian Federation across the European game three Monaco two-thirds of Monaco shares are owned by Russian billionaire Dmitry rebel of length who took over when the club was bottom of leader in December 2011 by May 2013 they had won promotion to ligue earn again and rebel of lev financed the costly acquisitions of Radamel Falcao and hammers Rodriguez to get the side back into the Champions League but the remaining 33% of the club belongs to the house of Grimaldi the Monegasque royal family and they still wear a shirt reportedly inspired by Grace Kelly the Hollywood actress who married Prince Rainier in 1956 the current prince albert ii has always had an interest in sports having competed for Monaco in five Winter Olympics in the bobsleigh and he approved River la fleurs bid for the club reasoning there's a team who stadium sits between marinas full of super yachts deserves the glamour of international competition he has been rewarded with the first championship in 17 years and Monaco returning to the top of French football as well as reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League

normally just guarantee club support as in the case of CSKA but instead L guy abused their position to force players to join them in 2011 highly rated midfielder Ayman hefney was called up for his mandatory military service but rather than simply taking a break from football while he trained with the army hefney was loaned out and then sold to L guys with the Armed Forces claiming that his three years there would constitute national service this interference from the government meant that in the 2016-17 season 10 of the Egyptian Premier League's 18 sides actually had no fans who had

taking the might of not just one country but three to put manchester city at the summit of European football before 2007 city was a publicly traded company meaning that anyone could buy shares

acquire the side after failing with moves for liverpool and full of sinha watt road made his money in telecommunications and used his political power to increase his fortune dodging taxes and laundering nearly three billion dollars through foreign bank accounts that made him unpopular in thailand and eventually he was overthrown by the military but his investment in city proved smart

or government-affiliated entities. Starting with Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), owned by the Qatar Investment Authority since 2011, it highlights how PSG's financial status transformed through investments by the Emir of Qatar. Iranian club Persepolis is controlled by the Iranian Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports but struggles financially despite state support. The Chinese club Beijing Guoan benefits from state ownership under the CITIC Group and a lucrative TV deal, enhancing its competitiveness. Barcelona and Real Madrid, although privately owned, were scrutinized by the EU for receiving public funds, thus violating rules. Russian clubs CSKA Moscow and Zenit St. Petersburg have links to state ownership, through associations with the military and Gazprom respectively. Monaco is two-thirds owned by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, with one-third held by the Monegasque royal family. Talya El Geish, an Egyptian club, is owned by the military, using its influence to recruit players. Manchester City is noted for its transition to being owned by Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi, representing combined influence from several countries and involving past ownership by Thaksin Shinawatra, former Prime Minister of Thailand.

Criticisms from figures like Martina Navratilova and players like Coco Gauff highlight concerns about hosting prestigious women's sports events in Saudi Arabia while it remains a religious monarchy with a track record of treating women as second-class citizens. Despite the criticisms, the WTA defends the decision, citing the importance of creating new opportunities for women to play professional tennis globally. The transcript then examines Saudi Arabia's broader efforts in sports, labeled as ""sportswashing,"" as the nation seeks to improve its global image through investments in high-profile sports events and athletes. Saudi involvement includes the acquisition of Newcastle United, bids to host the 2034 Men's World Cup, and creating the LIV Golf league. The controversy extends to associations with former President Trump, whose business and political ties with Saudi Arabia may influence potential PGA-LIV deals. The transcript suggests that Saudi Arabia aims to expand into women's sports despite ongoing concerns about women's rights in the Kingdom.",Sportswashing,-1,No,Gulf multi-sport hosting,Saudi Arabia
0TloNP2_f-0,Saudi Arabia sports minister calls ‘sportswashing' claims 'very shallow' - BBC News,Saudi Arabia's Sports Minister says claims of sports washing against the country are very shallow he's been defending the right to host the 2034 World Cup critics say unprecedented spending on sport has been used to improve Saudi Arabia's reputation over its human rights record and environmental impact our Sports Senator Dan Ron has been to the country he was accompanied by Saudi Ministry of sport officials and he spoke to Prince abdulaziz Ben turkey alel in an exclusive interview our ambition is to host the best events around the world and theing om for the people of the of the Kingdom to see but also to invite uh the world to the kingdom you have Formula 1 I think is one of them uh FIFA World Cup and the Olympics uh these are the highest uh events that Any Nation would love to to to to host within within their countries do you want to be the sort of number one sporting superpower in the world I don't see it that we're competing with others I see it that we're playing our role to develop Sports within within the world and to be part of the International Community I'm sure sure that hopefully by the 2034 uh people will have uh an extraordinary World Cup that they remember is your expectation your highness that it would be staged now in Winter I don't know yet to be honest uh definitely we're studying both options to see what is the best option to host the World Cup you're saying it's possible you could host it in summer you haven't rolled that out that's we're actually studying that you're studying that how how how could you do that when the temperature is so hopefully we'll find out definitely we'll work to make sure that it's the best world cup to ever be hosted in any country for those who say that Saudi Arabia is not a suitable host what would your message be to them I think we've showcased that we've hosted more than 85 Global events and we've delivered on the highest level so when you're accused of sports washing does that frustrate you I think it's very shallow uh on on what they and and I'm sure that a lot of the people that accuse us of that haven't been to Saudi or haven't seen what we're doing on the ground but when they come and they see 9 6 years old kids have that opportunity uh to meet with the best in the world when they meet Cristiano Ronaldo or they meet uh the top athletes that come uh that's that's opportunity human rights campaigners will say well look at the imprisoning of uh campaigners for women's rights any country around the world has room for improvement no one's perfect and we acknowledge that and we are reforming uh and these events help us reform women's participation in sport has increased uh by 50% uh compared to the population so that opportunity and these reforms that have been opened up have have given opportunity to the youth uh men and women to to participate in the sports that they love there will be some who ask if they're gay or if they're a woman is this a place they'll be welcome will they be safe if they were attending the World Cup we've hosted a lot of events in the past more than 85 events uh everyone's welcome in the Kingdom uh like any other nations in around the world we have rules and regulations that everyone should abide with than respect uh when we come to the UK we respect the rules and regulations whether we believe in them or not during the Qatar World Cup build up uh there was a lot of controversy around the treatment of Migrant workers because of the amount of building work required in such a short space of time is that a problem that could be repeated with a World Cup here I assure you it's not going to be repeated uh we have 10 years uh to work on that we already started and a lot of the venues uh so we have a long time to do it in the right time in the right process and also with the collaboration with FIFA to to to put the right steps in there's been a lot of debate around the bidding process that led you to becoming the soul bidder for 34 we've been studying it for a long time uh and when we saw the opportunity come in we submitted a bit uh to because we were ready what we should look at is what benefits the sport of football so no deals with FIFA because people said lack of transparency everyone voted everyone was clear on the regulations uh nobody objected to them during there so I don't think there was any lack of transparency from FIFA uh it was only that we were ready to do it uh and maybe others word uh that's not our fault I think some people say Saudi Arabia one of the biggest oil exporters in the world and a lot of this is again designed to maybe distract attention from that fact you reject that I reject that completely because we are taking that seriously and we we are part of this globe so we have to make sure that our future as well is is is confined in the in the right uh for in the right way for our kids how confident are you that the environmental cost of staging such an event in this country is worth the benefits it's a mandate on us in the 2030 Vision to make sure that we abide by the international regulations we abide by the international requirements to make sure that we play our role to make sure that it's eco-friendly but how is staging a massive event consistent with that is it not a contradiction not at all because as I said it's part of our development we take that in consideration what do we need to do to make it efficient for the environment towards that and we work on that you mentioned the pro league the players that you have managed to attract are being taken away from other leagues so do you think for example the Premier League should be worried are you a threat to the Premier League I think the Premier League did that and that's how they started so nobody questioned them when they did it so as I said our focus is to develop Sports within the kingdom to develop our league there are some matches that attract much more audience than than others but all of our you know uh big matches I would say have attracted record numbers so far in terms of viewership in terms of attendance in the in the stadiums when we thought about this and we plann to develop the league we never thought that we'd do it such Pace but to see that is actually uh refreshing and it actually showcases the importance of this Saudi Arabia Sports Minister there speaking to our sports editor Dan Rowan around the world and across the UK this is BBC News,"The transcript is an interview

mYGTNHfgZ8E,Saudi Arabia’s Plan to Conquer Global Golf,the opening shot of Gulf civil war came in the form of a press release published on a Friday in late October of 2021 the newly formed company live golf Investments with the backing of the Saudi Sovereign wealth fund announced its commitment of 200 million dollars to establish 10 new Marquee professional golf tournaments it also announced its new CEO the Brash Australian the former world number one golfer the shark Greg Norman and it announced well little else who would play where they'd play and exactly how these tournaments would be played were details for a later date instead the release opted for platitudes and an ominous promise that this was only the beginning for other established sports leagues it might be easy to write off the arrival of such an overly vague and optimistic Challenger the established leagues have the money they have the TV deals and most importantly they have the talent the PGA Tour the most prestigious golf circuit in the world however is a little different while it has the money and TV deals it doesn't pay for the luxury of keeping its Talent locked down whereas most professional sports leagues pay their players consistent base salaries with the occasional incentive looped into a contract the PGA Tour only pays for winning for the world's very best this works just fine show up to a third or maybe a half of the 40-something annual PGA tournaments post a score good enough to land in the money or even win outright bring home the winnings and cash in on the media attention through endorsement deals but this creates a problem for those in the middle and back of the pack Elite golfers in their own right but golfers who are paying for their own travel coaching and accommodations only to quite possibly finish outside the money if they don't play to their full potential all this is to say the PGA Tour and its pay structure along with its stuffy hesitant to change culture was ripe for a challenge and they knew it as well as anyone the counter to the live announcement came from the tour's wary commissioner Jay Monahan who sent each tour member a memo explaining they were sweetening the pot for the upcoming season there would be more prize money at tournaments more money devoted to the player IMPACT program that compensates for their roles in boosting the tour's engagement and that there be an entirely new bonus fund for players appearing in 15 or more PGA events if the carrot wasn't enough there was also the stick along with more money Monahan also warned that if players defected to whatever this new leak was they'd be banned from playing in the PGA tour for one of golf's biggest names and one of the pga's highest earners the carrot wasn't enough and the stick was just another example of an organization with too much power ing Monahan's counter Phil Mickelson the longtime fan favorite The Lovable Lefty who just so happened to be playing in the Saudi International Tournament took the time in an interview about his future to point out that the PGA tour's greed had reached obnoxious proportions that their hoarding of players digital meteorites worth millions among other things was pushing players to look for new places to play while he didn't say that he had found a new place to play the writing was on the wall secession was in the air back in the States the tour went on but at each stop the tension built rumors circulated on who was making the jump and ever so quietly offers of guaranteed contracts in the tens of millions began making their way to top players then suddenly as the golf world descended on the Riviera golf course in California's Pacific Palisades for the Genesis open a bombshell article rocked the Sports World nearly collapsing the Saudi coup before it even really took shape with his new biography on Mickelson available for pre-order and the media Buzz over the mysterious Saudi Challenger building Alan shipnick felt the timing was right to pull back the curtain Mickelson was in fact working with the startup Saudi League having already recruited three other top players to make the flip but of bigger consequence Mickelson was aware of the bigger picture too he called the league nothing more than sportswashing he called the Saudis scary and he made no qualms about the fact that the move was about nothing more than money and leverage in the story's wake golfers now had to make their intentions clear to fans and media were they so focused on the money they'd Overlook Saudi Arabian atrocities like the money obsessed Mickelson some stayed Coy alluding to or outright mentioning that they'd sign ndas effectively signaling that they were likely deep in negotiations with Liv or had already come to an agreement but most especially golf's biggest names who were rumored targets of live went out of their way to align themselves with the PGA Tour and to disparage the saudi-backed Challenger before anyone really knew what it would be the Saudi project seemed dead Mickelson stepped away from golf for the moment and the world moved on Then Greg Norman announced the live golf invitational eight tournaments five of which not halfway across the world but in the US an eye-watering 255 million dollars in prize money for a field of only 48 players and a format that had golfers only playing three rounds rather than four essentially it was a tour with convenient locations Lower stress less competition and prize money that on a tournament by tournament basis would usually more than double what the PGA Tour offered it was a tour whose leader was one of gaul's most famous figureheads it was a tour that conveniently distanced itself from its Saudi Arabian roots in locations and branding and it was a tour that injected more money to the sport than anyone could have imagined for its part the PGA Tour thought it was in the clear they had already dangled the carrot outlined potential punishment and after benefiting from Mickelson putting his foot in his mouth they simply couldn't be bothered they had moved on players though began to reconsider one by one they decided that perhaps it wasn't too toxic of a public relations move to join the tour or that the money was at least more valuable than the image hit Dustin Johnson was the first big name to turn on his early promise to back the PGA signing for 125 million dollars to flip allegiances and resigning his PJ membership then at the very first live tournament the benefits of defecting became all the more obvious as Charles schwartzel a lower profile PGA Tour player who hadn't finished first in a Tour event in six years ended up winning a cool 4.75 million dollars not long after dechambeau 2 countered his previous statements and joined the saudi-back tour then came Brooks kepca and cam Smith two of golf's brightest stars golf Civil War the one the PGA Tour thought it had already won was a back-on with the Saudi side flipping the battlefield with nothing more than a massive influx of cash live however is far from Saudi Arabia's first foray into professional sports this is World Wrestling entertainment's 2022 schedule of pay-per-view events while WWE packs a Non-Stop calendar of TV shows and non-televised events these specials are the ones you hear about the biggest money makers for the entertainment company they feature the biggest stars Roman Reigns Hulk Hogan Brock Lesnar John Cena The Undertaker and the biggest plot points in the series's ongoing scripted narrative correspondingly they are rare 2022 saw 17 across the year just three of which occurring outside the U.S September's clash of the castle in Wales while the two other international events were held in Jeddah and Riyadh searching through the company's quarterly reports it's no wonder why every few quarters the media Revenue attributed to the other category shoots up by about 50 million dollars dating back to 2018 the quarters when this happens corresponds exactly to when the company hosts an event in Saudi Arabia it even drops out when events were canceled due to covet this has led to an understanding that Saudi Arabia is paying the company about 50 million dollars per event scanning down and to the right puts that into perspective with a mere two per year summing to a massive 100 million dollars these Saudi events are responsible for close to 10 percent of the annual revenue of the world's 37th most valuable Entertainment Company and they've been popular for all the scripted nature of WWE allows the company to guarantee it at the 2022 event in Wales Clash at the castle many speculated that reigning Champion Roman Reigns would be set to lose to Scottish Contender Drew McIntyre because this Scottish Underdog winning against the American champion is exactly what the European fans would want to see and traditionally the entertainment companies scripts their storylines to entertain their fans but in this case the customer with Saudi Arabia and in order to guarantee the reigning Champion would fight up-and-coming star Logan Paul in Riyadh that November a fight that was sure to generate massive attention Roman Reigns had to win in Wales but the drama outside the arena was far more real three years prior the 2019 edition of the same Crown Jewel event failed to air live as scheduled in its host country there is still no official explanation for this but there are plenty of rumors they go that the Saudi government was late on a 60 million dollar payment for the prior event that part is corroborated in financial reports and either to force their hand or in retribution WWE briefly cut off the feed to the Saudi local broadcaster ultimately the event did make it to broadcast in its host country with a one-hour tape delay but then WWE faced its own issues as 200 performers and Personnel gathered for their 3am Charter flight to Buffalo New York where the company's Flagship Monday Night Raw show is being filmed flight crew started to announce delay after delay after delay with no real explanation for why one Anonymous wrestler later testified in a lawsuit against WWE stating that the doors of the plane were blocked by armed guards in Black militia attire and that a crew member stated it seems someone doesn't want us to leave the country the wrestler also said the company's senior director of talent relations told him that the payments dispute had truly occurred that the feed was cut and that the Saudi Crown Prince was quote very mad this interpretation of the events led many to describe it as a hostage incident that Saudi Arabia failed to allow the plane to take off to get back at WWE now this testimony is only one small part of a larger suit alleging that WWE misrepresented broadcast rights negotiations with the Saudi government to its investors but despite their best efforts WWE could not get this lawsuit dismissed and settled for 39 million dollars not an emission of guilt but at least an indication that it was too difficult to disprove the claims of course WWE has vehemently denied rumors of this so-called hostage incident claiming that it was just mechanical issues wrestlers meanwhile have been tight-lipped and vague when talking about it potentially wary to threaten their highly lucrative contracts with a company but in this case the facts hardly matter to Saudi Arabia because the public believes it the country turned the spotlight on itself and in return a story emerged that only shaped the uninformed understanding of how the country and its ruling Royals operates and it's hardly the only time this has happened in 2022 the second ever Saudi Arabian Grand Prix a stop on formula one's Globe spanning calendar was overshadowed by a massive plume of smoke in the background this was visible during the Friday's practice sessions but as on track action finished up for the night reports emerged that this wasn't a simple fire it was an attack more specifically it was an attack by houthi rebels who fight one side of the ongoing Civil War in neighboring Yemen now this conflict is widely understood as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran Iran is supporting the houthi rebels Saudi Arabia the former central government worried that a houthi-led Yemen would function as a satellite state of Iran an untenable proposition given their massive land Porter therefore the houthis regularly undertake attacks on Saudi Arabia as they did in this case on an oil Depot on the outskirts of Jeddah immediately a driver's union meeting was called to discuss whether they'd forced a cancellation of the race and reportedly the initial consensus was yes in the minutes and hours that followed a rotating cast of Team principles former the one executive Saudi Arabian officials and others came through the room convincing drivers of the strength of air defense systems around the track and supposedly discussing the quote consequences of the race not going ahead as planned meanwhile discussion erupted on social media as pictures emerged from the endless drivers meeting and much of it was over why the race would be threatened by a drone attack in the first place in the end after four and a half hours stretching into the early morning drivers relented and the race one had as planned but once again the spotlight shown on Saudi Arabia and the picture wasn't pretty the kingdom has been widely condemned for its role in what the UN describes as the world's worst humanitarian crisis in Yemen they've imposed an error in C blockade on the country that has contributed to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians due to famine according to Human Rights Watch there is also a pattern of saudi-led strikes on civilian areas or on Military Targets in densely populated areas where civilian casualties are inevitable both of which are a violation of the laws of war the Saudi Coalition has also engaged in so-called double tapping where one airstrike is conducted then another is later done in the same spot on those that come to Aid the injured but Saudi Arabia's repressiveness is not best defined by its war crimes after all tragically they are hardly the only nation conducting such attacks there is wide understanding that a number of developed Middle Eastern nations are repressive by Western standards Nations like Qatar and the UAE are known for the dissonance between their flashy westernized cityscapes and their limited human rights both engage in widespread modern slavery both severely limit women's rights both heavily restrict freedom of speech in the Press both have zero LGBT rights and police forces that regularly abuse and torture queer people the list goes on and on but even compared to this Saudi Arabia isn't a league of its own whereas Qatar and the UAE have laws on the books criminalizing homosexuality but rarely enforce them Saudi Arabia does regularly punishing with prison sentences lashes and even execution whereas Qatar restricts access by women to certain venues and the UAE forbids women from initiating divorce without court order Saudi Arabia still operates under a strict guardianship system where women must obtain approval from a male Guardian for certain rights for example women of all ages need their guardian's approval to marry and once married women are legally required to remain quote obedient to their husband even to the extent of not refusing sex without a quote legitimate excuse but the nation's brutality can't even be fully described in such a comparative manner because a key tenet of it is the fact that Saudi Arabia barely has codified laws judges sentence based on ambiguous and changing interpretations of sharia law which is based on the Quran but that means people are regularly sentenced even to death from ambiguous unprovable crimes leading to wide-scaled institutionalized jailing and killing of those who Dare Challenge the ruling Royal Family's reign in any way according to Freedom House's annual freedom in the world survey the nation is by a sizable margin the least free nation in the world to be so wealthy that puts the nation in a unique situation from a branding perspective all of these nations the other wealthiest in the world get wealthy World things like Golf and WWE and formula one and while far from perfect these other nations are on balance far less repressive than Saudi Arabia therefore When people's primary exposure to the nation is through wealthy World entertainment franchises it's only natural to assume that Saudi Arabia is similar to the UAE or United Kingdom or UK but Phil Mickelson at least recognized just how problematic the Saudi regime was when he noted their role in human rights abuse and the murder of Jamal khashoggi and the PGA Tour proved well aware too as time and time again they've brought up Saudi Arabia's role in 911 during their public battle against Liv for hearts minds and golfers but money simply proved too much for Mickelson in 2021 and in the summer of 2023 the PGA Tour found itself in the same position as the golfer on June 6 the PGA Tour announced something that not a single one of its players saw coming it was emerging with Liv the two leagues would quit poaching one another's players they dropped the lawsuits and counter lawsuits and the Saudi public investment fund would be the exclusive investor in the merge tour it was a complete shock it was bigger than golf bigger than Sports following the announcement commissioner Monahan who had railed against the atrocities committed by Saudi Arabia offered a statement trying to justify the deal while 911 families golfers who had turned down tens of Millions on principles that Monahan had outlined and The Wider World quickly called him and the tour Hypocrites Monahan was a hypocrite But ultimately from a business perspective he was likely right to concede in the coming days it became clear that Monahan had understood this for a while telling tour employees that they couldn't compete with a foreign government with unlimited money in a private meeting and started the process of negotiating some months earlier the merger was at once indefensible and inevitable because neither money nor profitability were the reason for Saudi Arabia's entrance into professional golf live with hardly a TV deal or any real path to profitability would simply Outlast the PGA tour with an estimated 50 million dollars spent in legal fees and a hundred million dollars spent on bigger purses and player bonuses PGA Tour reserves had begun to run dry by early 2022 and the only recourse was to give the Sovereign wealth fund what it really wanted a seat at the table with every additional overlap between professional sports and Saudi Arabia Global media speculates on what the nation's intentions truly are it's not money at least not now as they're spending far more than could ever return to develop their profile of professional sports it's also not the short-term image effects as often suggested since for as much as Formula One or WWE or live imply a level of legitimacy for the nation they also highlight its repressiveness and regressiveness it's only natural the nation is repressive and regressive so when you bring International cameras and journalists and attention that can't be stymied by intimidation arrest and imprisonment as domestic equivalence can inevitably the world is going to hear about the nation's issues and when the global consensus is that legitimizing Saudi Arabia through Sports is a bad idea stories or even rumors proving that point are only going to be Amplified further but it's ultimately quite tough to evaluate decision making in an absolute monarchy at the end of the day maybe Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman just really likes sports or maybe he just wants fun events for him and his wealthy friends or maybe there's not much strategy at all behind this foray interprofessional Sports since even the billions being spent on it are a poultry sum compared to the scale of royal family wealth in Saudi Arabia perhaps the most cohesive explanation though is that this isn't some short-term branding exercise the kingdom isn't expecting the world to think positively about it just because they put on some decent golf rather this seems one small part of the nation's massive reorientation Saudi Arabia is trying very very hard to set itself up for a post-oil era in doing so it's trying very very hard to become a place like Dubai a diversified modern service-based Middle Eastern economy as integrated with the world as Singapore or Sao Paulo it's trying to end its era of isolation and become a player in international Affairs as the era of insularity funded by oil exports draws closer to a close this is a practical necessity for the ruling family since the tolerance of their grip on power has been undergirded by the prosperity brought to the nation during their reign if this Prosperity fails to maintain into a post-oil era so too might the monarchy itself as part of this genuine reform is happening many of the nation's most repressive policies are no longer but mostly the most visible ones the indiscriminates arrest jailing torture and execution of dissonance and activists still occur the absence of democracy is still unchanged sports are dominating the conversation about Saudi Arabia but they're also creating conversation they're not necessarily supposed to be immediately and directly effective at rebranding the nation rather they're part of the long game WWE or formula one or professional golf just embed themselves with other parts of the wealthy World naturally Saudi Arabia as it makes its transition out of insularity needs to force it they're faking it until they make it so the question asked every time they make an additional encroachment into sports is whether it's right to help Saudi Arabia fake it before they've made it before they've genuinely turned themselves into a place that respects human rights Sports Executives constantly argue that the order of operations is right that engagement with Western culture will propagate Western principles of Human Rights but through this these executives are making a massive gamble on whether they'll land on the right side of History because the other option is that their executive bonuses are being based on their culpability in branding the nation as a place that respects human rights without them actually doing so because after all the best possible future for saudi's rulers is that they get to continue their autocratic ways while being perceived and treated by the Western world as a normal place the world has problems in many cases because power is concentrated and held by a small number of individuals who happen to be the same people who are best able to profit from problems but despite that these same

Heo_bESl4cc,How Saudi Arabia bought into golf - BBC News,whether you're into golf or not what happened this week matters many critics are looking at this and saying well quite simply Saudi Arabia have bought the game of golf Time Magazine described how golf couldn't resist the cash which speaks louder than any human rights group and this is the deal that came out of the blue golf's two main tours are the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour and they've cut a deal with Saudi Arabia's public investment fund together the three will run men's professional golf this is the same state-owned fund that created live golf as a rival to the two main tours at the time the PGA Tours lawyers said that that was an effort to sportswatch the Saudi government's deplorable reputation for human rights abuses but the PGA Tours position has evolved from accusations of sports washing to a landmark agreement to unify men's professional golf an agreement with the people it accused of sports washing and soon after the deal was announced liftgolf player Phil Mickelson tweeted awesome day today Awesome's one word that's being used the PGA Tour anticipated that another would get some use too I recognize everything that you know that I've that I've said in the past and in my prior positions I recognize that people are going to call me a hypocrite and sure enough they have PGA Tour player Mackenzie Hughes tweeted nothing like finding out through Twitter that we're merging with the tour that we said we'd never do that with well this is world number three Rory McIlroy not thing that you galvanized everyone against you've not partnered with so of course I understand it it is hypocritical it sounds hypocritical that though hasn't stopped the deal being done and there are several billion reasons why but this isn't only about money the New York Times suggests the deal is the latest step in the Kingdom's push to become a global Force Beyond oil and in pursuit of that goal the Saudis created live golf and started offering much more money than anyone else in time some of the world's best players would sign up and they immediately face questions about Saudi Arabia's human rights record questions that remain for example there were close to 200 executions last year and the death penalty was reinstated for some drug-related crimes to which the UN has objected the death penalty for drug offenses is incompatible with International norms and standards a recent report by two campaign groups noted that the death penalty is routinely used for non-lethal offenses and to silence dissidence and protesters and Saudi Arabia's approach The Descent is well known a prominent critic of the government was the Saudi journalist jamarcusoji shortly after arriving at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018 he was killed U.S intelligence believed Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was complicit in the killing something the Saudis have denied and these human rights concerns were well known as live golf got underway it's an oracle event was in England in June last year featuring teams with names like Crushers stinger and smash and then and now there's no dividing line between the Saudi money pouring into golf and the Saudi State this is Chairman of Saudi Arabia's state-owned Oil Company he runs the Saudi public investment fund he'll be the chairman of the new entity that will run men's professional golf and he reports to Muhammad bin Salman this investment in golf is part of a national strategy a strategy that's also seen billions pouring into football boxing and formula one too and while we know that Saudi Arabia wants to make its economy less dependent on oil to many observers this investment is about something else too absolutely there are image and reputational benefits that can be accrued by investing in sport not just Saudi Arabia elsewhere in the world but I think Saudi Arabia right now is very keen to to shape people's perceptions and attitudes towards the country or to use the phrase of the PGA Tours lawyers last year the accusation is sports washing and the BBC's Dan Rohn tried to ask his CR ramyan about that last year because I should go quickly about the suggestions of sports watching what do you say to that what's your response I'm really not sure about this the terminology Mr Albion may not be sure about the terminology but he'll be sure of Saudi Arabia's Ambitions and how sport can help deliver them and far from everyone is enthused you and Murray in the guardian calls the new golf deal the latest depressing illustration that Bottomless Pits of money can disrupt and distort everything in sport well this is broadcast to Georgie Bingham money wins the day here there is nothing classy there is nothing historic there is nothing prestigious about what has happened yesterday this is to do with money no doubt this is to do with money but those in favor of the deal see positives they point to an end to all lawsuits between the tours and the guarantee of Saudi Investment for years to come and there's this too long term you've got to think the competition on the course is only going to get better and then the three parties involved in the deal call it a model that delivers maximum excitement and competition among the game's best players and watching this play out as U.S senator Chris Murphy he tweeted so weird PGA officials were in my office just months ago talking about how the Saudis human rights record should disqualify them from having a stake in a major American sport I guess maybe their concerns weren't really about human rights certainly those concerns haven't got in the way it turns out golf had a price and Saudi Arabia paid it and ahead of his latest tournament Rory McIlroy reflected on what's happened I've come to terms with it um I see what happened in other sports I see what's happened in other businesses and honestly I've just resigned myself to the fact that this is you know this is what's going to happen it is now going to happen in golf it will surely happen elsewhere too as in a range of different ways Saudi Arabia seeks to turn its wealth into Global power and influence and as Rory McIlroy notes it's very hard to keep up with people that have more money than anyone else it is and as the Saudis keep spending it's a lesson that's relevant far beyond golf,"The transcript details a significant development in the world of professional golf, highlighting a merger between the PGA Tour, the DP World Tour, and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. This merger has sparked criticism, with many arguing that Saudi Arabia has effectively purchased the sport of golf, overshadowing human rights concerns. Notably, earlier opposition from the PGA Tour regarding Saudi sportswashing allegations has diminished, transitioning into cooperation despite prior criticisms of Saudi Arabia's human rights track record, including executions and the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The transcript explores the motivations behind Saudi Arabia's investments, suggesting the country aims to build influence beyond oil through sports while improving its global image. Critics view the merger as financially motivated, overshadowing the sport's traditional values. Reactions vary, with some seeing potential benefits like enhanced competition and financial stability. Nonetheless, Saudi investments in global sports raise ethical questions, as money increasingly dictates the landscape of professional sports.",Sportswashing,-1,No,LIV Golf,Saudi Arabia
GSJUgWgtDpU,Why Saudi Arabia Is Spending Billions To Fund A Hostile Takeover Of Professional Golf,the kingdom of saudi arabia reigns over a giant desert sitting on top of big pools of oil so why then is it attempting a hostile takeover of one of the world's oldest sports a game played on lush irrigated expanses of turf strategically placed water hazards and water hungry putting greens some of pro golf's biggest names have flocked to the deep pockets of the live golf tour dustin johnson phil mickelson brooks kepka and most recently british open winner cam smith this is the biggest story in golf since probably tiger woods in response golf's old guard the pga tour is making big changes to the way its top players get paid what's happening here is unprecedented you know you have a foreign government that's investing in and trying to take over a sport which is much different than businesses that are doing business in that country when you when you're joining that league you are playing for the kingdom of saudi arabia and i think that that's an important distinction because this fight between the pga and live is very much about money billions and billions of dollars it's about the future of saudi arabia a changing country trying to position itself for a world that doesn't rely on oil it's also about crown prince mohammed bin salman's attempt to finally escape the fallout from the gruesome murder of jamal khashoggi they want to show that they have a cachet and a prestige that's not previously associated with saudi arabia and so if they can get the world's greatest professional golfers to golf on saudi sand then i guess they've started to get that [Music] when you look back on it it seems so obvious where the weaknesses were in the tour and and why this startup overcame a goliath company how did this all start back in october of 2021 former australian pro golfer greg norman known as the shark was introduced as the ceo of live golf norman has a colorful history when it comes to taking on the pga tour then in february 2022 the golf world became engulfed in a firestorm phil mickelson an aging fan favorite who became the oldest major championship winner in history the year before admitted he was getting into business with liv golf all this despite the league's connections to what he called scary he was referring to the hit squad that killed saudi dissident and journalist jamal khashoggi in a horrific fashion mickelson lost sponsor after sponsor he basically went into hiding for a few months and other big-name pga pros began pledging allegiance to the tour and denouncing his comments the live golf series appeared to be in big trouble then a few months later it wasn't dustin johnson a former number one ranked golfer in the world announced he was joining the rival tour that opened the flood works evolution can be uncomfortable but we love this crazy game enough to try so join us because the future we see is bright the future of golf is here [Music] they have attracted some of the biggest names in the sport with huge huge signing bonuses 200 million have been reports for phil mickelson and upwards of a hundred million for a lot of the players such as bryson de chambeau brooks kepca dustin johnson and what matters is the superstars and what that is gonna attract them is the guaranteed money and we're gonna pay them like the superstars they are and for all the revenue that they're driving to the pga tour they're gonna get a bigger share of that at live because we only have 48 players and we're going to generate more money for the rest of the 2022 golf season every major and big tournament became overshadowed by the latest high-profile departure to the live golf series this is muhammad bin salman crown prince saudi arabia and this is neom the future city he has already committed 500 billion dollars to turn desert rock and sand into an overnight metropolis for years saudi leaders have been getting news from their advisors saying that if oil ever runs out or people don't need your oil anymore then saudi arabia is screwed so mbs was the first leader who came around and said all right we're actually going to try something bin salman is a chief architect of the saudi vision 2030 plan an ambitious project to diversify the kingdom's economy away from oil tourism tech entertainment mbs wants saudi arabia to rival nearby city-states like dubai and abu dhabi mbs is effectively unlimited in his power he has had delegated to him the power of the king of saudi arabia his father which means that what he says goes and that's allowed him to essentially make a deal with saudis and with the world outside saudi arabia regarding his reforms he says i'm going to change the economy i'm going to change the relations between the sexes i'm going to limit the power of conservative religious forces and in exchange you're going to not limit my power at all you're not going to have any political diminishment of what i can do saudi arabia is rich its state-owned oil company saudi aramco is the largest company in the world the 620 billion public investment fund is also one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world that's the major financial backer of the live golf tour this is a commercial investment that a fund is making a private equity fund is making in the world of golf and they do business all over the world in in in including in many companies in the united states so we are just one of those but it needs foreign investment and outside business partners in order to pull this all off and that's where sports comes in golf is a unique professional sport outside of a few times a year there are no set teams so instead of having to pay a couple billion dollars to buy a single team like the public investment fund did with newcastle and england's premiership it took a couple billion dollars and created a whole new league saudi arabia has been looking for any way to really own a whole space and they saw live golf as one of the ways it's not like they're going to just own one team in a league they will own the whole thing and they will have control over it and they will have the ability to make themselves seem like a responsible steward of something other than just oil i have no idea whether in the case of golf they're going to look like responsible stewards of this very old game but it's a familiar move for them to try to move into a space especially one that's in the kind of sports entertainment space and try to change their reputation of being an intolerant unpleasant anxious unchanging conservative place the top golfers in the live tour and pga are now locked in a high-stakes legal battle in response to their rival pga tour leaders banned the live tour golfers from playing in the rest of the 2022 season turns out the live golfers still wanted to compete in pga events so they filed a lawsuit over it accusing the pga of running a monopoly the allegation that's being made is first that the pga tour has a monopoly over some form of a golf market or golf labor market and second by excluding those players that were to compete in the liv tour that pga is engaging exclusionary conduct which is meant to strengthen a monopoly or attempt to boost a monopoly like any high-stakes legal battle it's going to take a long time to see who comes out on top this is one of these very rare cases in anti-trust where law transacts with politics and it's not something i've seen very much i mean if you ask me from a purely political level to be really frank i have some concerns i have concerns about the sortie government funding huge amounts of money into the united states i have some concerns about the relationship with donald trump quite frankly with all the ongoing investigations into the former president and not knowing the way that will play out uh but if you leave aside political concern and we look at this within the structure of just simply the behavior and an anti-trust analysis the section two claim has very real weight behind it presuming the players are able to show monopoly power that will be their biggest challenge in the meantime there's another battleground the system that ranks golfers internationally right now live golf events don't factor in what's called the official world golf ranking system that's how most golfers get to play in the majors the masters us open pga championship and the british open the majors are all separate entities so they're run by different organizations the masters is run and operated by augusta national the golf course the pga of america and the pga tour used to be the same thing but then there was a split so the pga of america runs the pga championship not the pga tour the pga tours landmark event is the players championship the usda runs the u.s open and then the open championship in the uk is run by the rna so these all these different entities a lot of golf insiders call them the five families even though the pga has its own playoff system and a championship golf superstars get measured by how many majors they've won past major winners can play in those events including those on the live tour there are other ways to get invited to the majors but for most of the golfers on the live tour they can't play in golf's most prestigious most competitive events without those owgr rankings these are the biggest events in golf the pinnacle and it's a really rare thing in any sport that the organization that runs week in week out tournaments does not control any of the four biggest events in the sport saudi arabia just a few years ago effectively had no entertainment which is almost impossible for americans to understand really what that means if you went out you went to these gender segregated restaurants you might hang out with your male friends and so people stayed in in their homes isolated and watched tv that was social life and it was unpleasant for saudis themselves family life was was rich but entertainment outside the home was was not and so when you see the profusion of athletic facilities gyms movie theaters what you're really seeing is a whole society that was hungry for entertainment finally getting it and suddenly they're getting it all at once and golf is like that i mean it's a spectacle welcome to the future of golf the tour's best play is to lean into the competition kind of provide zag where the the saudi arabian skins are zigging you know you can't match the saudi arabian public investment funds money but what you can do is you can provide a more competitive tour which really matters when you look at you know major championships and that's what players are remembered for and that's what eventually gets the big sponsor deals what gets the big paydays is winning major championships really what you have is two competing products it's just like if you go for coffee and there's a starbucks and a dunkin donuts across the street you have two golf products and it's diluting the talent on each of the tours right there's not a tour that has all the best players anymore for now professional golf remains in disarray the saudi-backed tour is picking up momentum and the pga tour is digging in for a long fight you,"The transcript explores Saudi Arabia's venture into the golf industry through its LIV Golf tour, causing significant upheaval in the sport. Notable players like Dustin Johnson, Phil Mickelson, and Brooks Koepka have joined this Saudi-backed league, lured by massive signing bonuses, which has sparked a fierce rivalry with the traditional PGA Tour. This rivalry stems not only from financial competition but also from Saudi Arabia's larger geopolitical ambitions to diversify its economy away from oil dependence, embodied in the Vision 2030 plan led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The tensions highlight international concerns, including human rights issues, notably the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, which still casts a shadow over Saudi investments. The transcript discusses the intricate legal battles between the two golf tours, with the LIV Golf tour allegedly excluding players from PGA events, leading to accusations of monopolistic practices. There are also implications for golfers' future careers, particularly concerning international rankings that determine their participation in major championships. The transcript raises issues about Saudi Arabia's global economic influence and the societal transformation domestically as entertainment and sports become more central to public life. The narrative suggests this move is partly to enhance Saudi Arabia's reputation globally and within its borders.",Sportswashing,-1,No,LIV Golf,Saudi Arabia
xKw_YRXTmCs,PGA Saudi LIV Golf Merger IMPLODING Already | Breaking Points,hey I'm Matt Stoller author of Monopoly focused substack newsletter big and an Anti-Trust policy analyst you have a great segment for you today on this big breakdown it's an Anti-Trust analysis of the proposed merger between the PGA Tour and the Saudis live golf which was announced about two weeks ago it actually already feels like quite a while and the narrative on the deal since it was first announced has completely changed so I'm going to go into that as well okay so let me give you the tldr the deal is already falling apart now first let's start at the beginning here's cnbc's David Faber going on the details of what happened the day of the announcement the PGA Tour and its Saudi back competitor live golf along with Europe's DP World Tour have agreed to merge in expectation of creating a global entity for the game of golf the agreement which is not yet a definitive agreement ends the hostility between Liv and the PGA along with the litigation between the parties and it calls for the giant Saudi Sovereign wealth fund pif which created live to invest significant I'm told what will be billions of dollars into the new entity that's over time okay so it was a big deal it was a huge deal it was announced Globe changing you know the Saudis geopolitical like changing the World of Golf like Donald Trump was involved it's sort of a massive massive thing but here is the gist of the terms so this was according to the athletic as best as they could tell okay so the tour is receiving upwards of two to three billion dollars plus all the litigation between the two parties and there's a lot of it and it's very bitter is going away now the background to this deal as far as we can tell and there here's important context is that the PGA Tour has been the ruler of pro golf for many decades in 1994 For example the Federal Trade Commission actually investigated the PGA tour for monopolization but Congress back then was as one would expect a fan of old Rich golfers and Congress actually threatened to cut the budget of the antitrust enforcers by 20 if they went ahead with a case so the FTC said okay we'll drop the complaint the vote was four to zero and until 2021 that's pretty much how things in the world of pro golf remained then the Saudi government through its public investment funder pif decided to finance a competitor to the PGA tour it's called live golf now live golf started learning top players and putting on Rival events and it created competition in the space it wasn't profitable it was a sort of a geopolitical push but it did create real competition for the first time in many decades now part of this is that the two entities have been in a bitter Anti-Trust suit over the nature of this competition and it's been going on for about a year there are allegations of anti-competitive behavior on the part of the PGA tour and the PGA Tour itself is under investigation by the government yet again now the story gets weirder as I noted Donald Trump is involved with his properties hosting live golf events put on by his Saudi allies he really wants in on professional golf money and PGA Tour prestige now if you read the antitrust complaint filed against the PGA Tour last year it seems pretty clear that the PGA Tour has been a problematic ruler of pro golf going back decades but especially now when they actually face arrival so quote members of the tour receive a substantially lower percentage of the tour's revenues than professional athletes in other major sports end quote that's what the players argued when Liv began challenging the PGA Tour it quote threatened lifetime bans on players who play in even a single live golf event and threaten sponsors vendors and agents to coerce players to abandon opportunities to play in live golf events end quote now this bitterness but also uh the the the the the general competition is consistent with pretty much all sports leagues rivalry and sports leagues tends to push up compensation for players and consolidation tends to do the Opposites what you'd expect with a monopoly when you are selling Sports Services as an athlete to one entity you're a price taker when you have a choice of two they have to bid for your services okay so to ward off the new competition the strategy of the PGA Tour they want to maintain their Monopoly was to denigrate live golf as funded by murderous Thugs and because of the Saudi government's bad track record here on human rights I mean they're murderous thugs a lot of players refuse to play in the new league so this merger shocked everyone who believed the PGA Tours human rights rhetoric those who believed it of course now on a broader level the public discussions were initially quite frantic about the rise of Saudi influence here's a headline in the New York Times the day of the deal oh my God the Saudis are so influential now like they've like they weren't influential before I saw Tom Friedman and Andrew Ross Sorkin on CNBC the morning of the announcement wondering whether the Saudis could do the same thing to the NBA or other sports leagues as part of this giant geopolitical play to control Athletics as if Athletics is not already dominated by huge sums of money and corporate power let's ask a different question is this deal legal is it actually going to happen after all we have antitrust laws that prohibit illegal mergers there is a lot of gray area and antitrust law you know some mergers it's like it's not totally clear that it's going to reduce competition so it's not clear that The Clayton Act applies that's what a lot of cases are about but here's the thing when two companies the only two companies want to merge to a monopoly and they announce it as such that's just a violation of black letter law and did that happen here well for that I'll go to the head of the PGA Tour Jay Monahan who said that this merger is good for his organization because it allows them to quote take the competitor off the board end quote okay when a corporate leader publicly says the point of a merger is to monopolize a market and eliminate a competitor I mean that's pretty crazy and I can only imagine what's in the private correspondence that usually lawyers go through when putting together an Anti-Trust case now it's not just me saying this all of the antitrust nerds that I'm friends with or that I know were in total disbelief at the audacity of these deal makers so scholar herb hobbykemp who's you know generally Monopoly friendly and very well respected in the antitrust bar said that this merger would be problematic in at least three markets so live attendance TV broadcast rights and advertising and call for compensation now given that live golf and the PGA Tour have been bidding aggressively for the services of golfers it seems pretty obvious that this deal will monopolize at least one of those markets so that's how we antitrust works it's it's about markets specific markets so herb hobbykemp puts out three markets but others can do it differently everybody agrees that there's just a monopoly going on here so now it is unusual for a corporate leader to announce he's doing a deal to remove a competitor as Bloomberg reporter Leah Nyland reported one reason he might be doing that is because quote no antitrust lawyers were involved in the PGA Tour live discussions that that's crazy every merger of any size involves at least calling an Anti-Trust lawyer and saying hey what do you think but not this one and so this choice to just not even talk to an Anti-Trust lawyer when they actually have antitrust lawyers on retainers suing each other it just doesn't make any sense but the PGA Tour and live golf you know they've got a big fight and they didn't ask one of their antitrust lawyers to attend a meeting where they sought to merge to a monopoly they also had deal maker lawyers and it's not whether they're not specialists in antitrust like they know that you know two to one merger is illegal so like what what is going on here and then there's the announcement itself which is pretty vague Apparently after saying it's a merger the PGA Tour is now saying it's not a merger it's an alliance or it's a joint company in which they will put all assets or maybe it's a framework who knows one very clear point for the PGA Tour is that whatever this deal is it is intended to remove a competitor and legally that is what matters so as a result most antitrust lawyers who have commented on this deal publicly from the far right to the far left have scoffed at the very notion that this deal as announced is legal so I'm going to put a couple tweets on the board here's the former White House competition Chief Tim Wu he's a Columbia Law professors focused on antitrust he tweeted that the deal won't survive libertarian antitrust lawyer Josh Wright who's at George Mason he mocked the combination um and indeed it is a joke indeed it's so stupid that the PGA Tour and the Saudis have managed to turn Congress somehow against rich white golfers that is an accomplishment so Senator Richard Blumenthal for instance has demanded that the antitrust division look into the merger the antitrust division is looking into the merger and now the deal is probably going to face a challenge from enforces it's like almost impossible not to it's just a it's just disrespectful to just merge to Monopoly like doing a cocaine deal giant cocaine deal in front of a police station um there's also going to be a congressional hearing um now a different lawyer pointed out that it's it actually gets worse because it's not just the Department of Justice with jurisdiction but Great Britain and the European enforcers also have jurisdiction because you know it's a global combination it's a global Monopoly so now you can get around antitrust if they just pass a law saying that antitrust doesn't apply in uh in this particular case and that has happened so in 1966 when the AFL and the NFL wanted to merge football leagues Congress actually had to Grant an exemption to antitrust law is a side note the politician who did that was from Louisiana and he said if you're gonna if I'm gonna Grant this exemption you have to start a football team in New Orleans and that's why we have the New Orleans Saints so you can thank antitrust for the New Orleans Saints at any rate the point here is that unless America the American government the European Union and the British government all Grant an Anti-Trust exemption as Congress did for football in 66 the deal seems kind of crazy so okay to put it nicely the legal situation in dice is dicey and that's starting to have impacts on the discussions of whether the deal will actually go through so large Wall Street players are now possibly involved on the side of the actual golfers so the legal situation is to be nice dicey and that's starting to have impacts on the discussions of whether the deal will actually go through large Wall Street players are now possibly involved on the side of the golfers let's take a listen to CNBC talking about this I'm also told that Patrick can't lay one of the players uh who's also a player director whose sponsor includes Goldman Sachs is probably getting some good advice from the likes of Goldman Sachs here and has been an important voice here in terms of what are we going to get as players here for stepping up and saying yes to all of this given given that we were willing to accept a lot less to stay at the PGA so to speak than go to live golf in light of how a lot of the players like top player Rory McElroy are responding uh to play our compensation in the in this deal it's hard to see how it's gonna go smoothly for all sides without a lot more money being put into the the actual Arrangement so let's take a listen to what he said should the golfers who maybe stayed loyal and turned down live should they be made whole financially I mean the simple answer is yes the complex answer is how does that happen let's just be real here there's no actual reason to allow the merger it doesn't have to happen unlike team sports such as football or baseball golf is actually a sport of individuals and it doesn't actually require leagues it's more like boxing you can have boxing matches without having boxing leagues you can have lots of different types of tournaments you don't need just one league for golf in fact that's what a bunch of the antitrust complaints and investigations have been about from the 90s to today now obviously the PGA Tour and Saudi leaders understand at some level these legal and operational realities the people who run the pif are sophisticated so is the PGA Tour so what's really going on well honestly I don't quite know one possibility is that the Saudi government which funded live golf through its Sovereign wealth fund is trying to avoid embarrassment in February a Court ruled that the Saudis had to make their emails public in their antitrust suit with the PGA Tour they claimed oh we're a government we don't have to do that we're not like a regular company governments do have what's called sovereign immunity but a judge said look you have sovereign immunity when it's government business but you guys are running a golf league that's more like you're more like a corporation so yeah you have to tell us what what's going on you have to give us your emails and the Saudis don't want that neither is the PGA Tour but they knew it was going to happen that the Saudis didn't so one thing that's going on here is that they're ending all the litigation between live golf and uh and the PGA Tour and the Saudi emails will remain private it's true that there could be a merger Challenge and So Bad Emails could come out even if they try to bring this merger to a completion but a more likely path is that the antitrust division at the Department of Justice investigates the deal the Saudis drop their merger attempt before the trial and live golf shuts down there could be some sort of Saudi Investment in the PGA Tour later meanwhile everyone gets the headlines now which obscures the reality that the Saudis don't want emails made public and they can blame the antitrust division for the collapse of live golf even though what's really going on is live golf was never profitable in the first place anyway something weird is going on here and if the deal goes through which I don't think it will it's likely because of high-level political decision from the body Administration the EU and the British government to move it through as a favor to the Saudis I don't think that's going to happen it's easier just let live golf die and then have the Saudis make a separate unrelated investment in a few years or really not even do that there are a lot of other possibilities maybe they'll find a way to do some sort of divestment or change the terms to make the deal palatable though honestly I can't see how they do that make it legal but when you're dealing with Saudi Arabia Donald Trump Global Sports you can get to things like money laundering arm stealing Espionage weird diplomacy and all sorts of other conspiratorial stuff and I don't like speculating on that because it's like seeing ripples on an ocean and trying to guess what's happening beneath but one thing I can say is that this deal in its current form doesn't make any sense and that's starting to become clear thanks for watching this big breakdown

on the proposed merger between the PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia's LIV Golf. Initially perceived as a monumental deal, the merger aims to combine PGA Tour, LIV Golf, and Europe’s DP World Tour into a global golfing entity. The Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) was expected to invest billions into this new venture. Initially, the merger seemed to be designed to end hostilities and litigation between the PGA and LIV, a Saudi-backed competitor that had lured top players away and introduced real competition in the golf world for the first time in decades. However, the merger's legality is under scrutiny due to potential antitrust law violations, as it was seen as an attempt to monopolize and eliminate competition in the golf market.",Sportswashing,-1,No,LIV Golf,Saudi Arabia
aHtdkOeOUHs,PGA Merges With Saudi Backed LIV Golf | Counter Points,let's move on to this incredible basically takeover of golf uh by Muhammad bin Salma now it's being reported as a merger between uh the P the PGA and live golf which is the the Saudi funded rival that went around and was poaching a whole bunch of uh players in order to create like a rival tour you know massively overpaying them and then uh you know with the idea that they're gonna you know create this competition PGA Tour was uh responded by saying basically these are terrorists uh you know you've never had to apologize uh for being part of the PGA you're gonna have to apologize constantly if you're part of the live tour if you do that you're a complete sellout and uh and then uh next thing you know uh PGA Tour is selling out itself so if you look at if you look and Ben Walsh there has some of the details of the contract the PGA will still technically have the kind of voting majority on the board that governs this but the Saudis through their uh their Sovereign wealth fund will have the exclusive right to invest in other words they will own it like they are the owners and so what does it even mean at that point that the PGA players have a voting membership if it's completely funded and owned uh by by the Saudis this seems like just a complete Victory uh for them as far as I can see what's your read on it oh absolutely I mean the memes on this were incredible first of all who knew that golf Twitter was so funny not me um and speaking of which Speaking of Twitter let's roll the next element let's just put C2 up here uh this was a pretty interesting take by Senator Mike Lee um where he said the PGA golf tour is buying Saudi back live golf tour it looks like a long established dominant incumbent is inquiring a nascent competitor one that has been challenging its dominant position so there you see um a counter argument from actually an Anti-Trust angle which is pretty interesting too Matt Fuller then we can put the next element up here as we roll through a lot of the amusing reactions had this great tweet where he's like doing this transcript of a conversation between Saudi Arabia and the PGA Tour hey PGA golfers we have a bunch of money to offer you for our new league PGA you're ruining the game and sports watching your reputation of Human Rights abuses okay but what if we offered you a lot of money PGA today we like to announce a merger yeah basically and then uh there's just an incredible uh Confluence of events here so we can put the next element up this is a Wall Street Journal story about uh Secretary of State uh Anthony blinken he goes to Saudi Arabia and we're reportedly he's going to say that human rights are in the are he's going to take up the issue of human rights with the Saudis which of course is what the Biden Administration wants to posture as we'll see how substantive that ends up being and then uh finally this is maybe my favorite element of the story C5 we can put this tweet up um this is a tweet from Timothy Meads of a Donald Trump truth from what yeah July 18 2022 where he basically predicted this this is pretty crazy where he said all of those golfers that remain quote loyal to the very disloyal PGA and all this different forms will pay a big price when the inevitable merger with live comes and you get nothing from but a thank you from PGA officials who are making millions of dollars a year Ryan my question to you is Trump's uh there's nobody who knows corrupt business uh deals better than Donald Trump is this not him just having the perfect experience to predict the moment this was entire this was crystal clear to him like and he from his perspective he probably couldn't see how other people couldn't see where this was going he's like what part of this don't you guys understand like they have an enormous amount of money that they're willing to spend people like money they will eventually take the money and they will own you and I like the way that he well like isn't the right word for it the way that he addresses love right the way that he addresses the players who were trying to take a stand against this is is just amazing saying like look you guys are the fools because you're eventually going to be in the pay of MBS anyway uh and all you're not even you're all you're going to get is a pat on the head from the PGA while the PGA is eventually going to sell out take the money uh all these other players that are selling out are going to take the money and you're still going to end up working for the Saudis but just at the same pay or maybe even less uh than you're getting now and tragic as it is that turns out to have been you know basically 100 correct so we'd have now Anthony blinken going to Saudi Arabia and Ryan you know these you know this particular issue area very well of course the bind Administration wants to posture and they got their WS they got their Wall Street Journal headline uh assuming this is the one that they wanted as blanken visits Saudi Arabia human rights are back in Focus subheading Biden officials have pushed the Saudis to lift travel bans on American citizens so blinken is prepping to visit Saudi Arabia this week and prepping a human rights message to the Saudis how confident are you that that actually comes to fruition in a substantive way uh not vary because as you saw uh MBS Jack basically jacked up gas prices right right ahead of the announcement of the of the PGA takeover so it's it's almost in inaccurate to say that the Saudis uh are are buying PGA we are buying the PGA you know with the money that we're putting into our gas tanks and then sending over to MBS that he's then using to buy uh PGA and he's restricting oil production in order to drive up gas prices to help offset the tiny amount that he's going to spend for the PGA so blinking is going to have that that he's going to have to negotiate he's all like he's also going to be pushing he said for uh MBS to release a bunch of American residents you know who are being who are not allowed to who were being kept illegally in the country uh so a lot of them for social media posts on a social media platform as Saudi Arabia is a significant owner of Twitter you you constantly see new new stories of people uh being arrested and uh sentenced to in insanely long sentences uh for something that they said on on Twitter um a significant number of those are American residents or American citizens and so blanken is going to be taking up their cases so those are those are a couple things he's going to have to push meanwhile they're pushing and a cruel and absurd uh Yemen policy while they're there and that is probably the real driver of of Lincoln's visit which is to try to undermine these talks that are uh ongoing directly uh between Saudi Arabia and the houthis because the U.S says that they want a kind of quote-unquote U.N brokered peace and by un broker they mean a huge a huge role for the United States in the in those talks uh we the U.S is deeply concerned about the fact that China was able to and we've talked about this before on the show that China was able to reach this kind of day taunt uh between Iran and Saudi Arabia and as a result you wound up with these with these peace peace talks progressing so blinking is going to try to make sure that those peace talks jump from there over into basically a U.S brokerage situation that would then the U.S hopes you know continue to give them access uh to the Gulf of Aiden which is you know controls something like 40 percent of of the maritime economy all you know oil and shipping all flows uh through there and into the into the Mediterranean uh so that's that's really what's going on and so uh you know how much of a role is our human rights going to play into that and we'll see and what do you make lastly of Mike Lee's Anti-Trust argument in this case I mean I guess it's funny uh you know it'd be funny if uh Lena Khan FTC chair was able to come in and say you know what actually we're not going to allow this we want more competition in our in our golf leagues I don't I don't see that happening and also it doesn't he had to kind of contort what really happened uh in order to make it fit his uh his kind of joke there because it doesn't actually seem like the incumbent dominant uh player acquired a an upstart competitor it seems like the upstart competitor acquired the incumbent right uh but whatever like close enough for the close enough for a joke it's close enough for a joke and it also is true that you have these like two whether or not it's an upstart like two hugely uh groups that have a big swath of the market um joining each other up and people probably know this but like the NFL Major League Baseball those types of entities have carve outs to antitrust policy like written into law like they are legally allowed to operate illegally like that and in order uh to have that cartel uh you know to have this Monopoly on baseball the where we as a public are then able to uh regulate a baseball and football and basketball in ways uh that we otherwise uh wouldn't have wouldn't have been hey guys ready or not 2024 is fully upon us now and soccer and I have been brainstorming ways that we can really up our game for this critical election yeah we rely on our

primarily through their Sovereign Wealth Fund. The merger is perceived as Riyadh's victory in expanding its influence over the golf world despite initial resistance from the PGA. There's analysis of the situation's anti-trust implications and a reflection on how the Saudis strategically use their vast financial resources. The transcript also delves into geopolitical concerns, highlighting the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Saudi Arabia. The visit aims to address human rights issues and geopolitical maneuvers, such as oil production control and peace negotiations in Yemen involving China. The discussion captures criticisms, including a remark from Donald Trump predicting the merger's inevitability and framing it as a corrupt business deal. There are additional comments on the antitrust perspective and legislative exceptions for major sports leagues in the U.S. The transcript concludes with a note on funding independent coverage of upcoming elections.",Sportswashing,-1,No,LIV Golf,Saudi Arabia
D9KQDzyheUI,LIV Golf vs. the PGA - The Controversial Divide Over the Future of Golf,"The jogan Experience what do you think about the [ __ ] the live golf thing love it absolutely love it why not tell tell me more here's the reason and I told you I before this I know a guy that went over there uh and I and here's the thing some people love the preservation in the history of the PGA I get it tradition a lot of things about the PGA are [ __ ] and particularly the idea that the PGA had a stronghold on them it was kind of like it has like the remnants of like contracts from studios in the 50s for actors where you're like we own your [ __ ] ass your likeness your rights your images when the golfers golf they can't use that footage they have to license it from the PGA so if I'm out playing and I want to be like hey man I want to put up a post on Instagram about this dope ass putt I hit or whatever this great you have to buy it you have to buy your [ __ ] back from them [ __ ] why if I'm a if I'm Zion Williamson in the NBA and I [ __ ] yoke on some I put my dick in their [ __ ] face and dunk on them the NBA can't wait to give you the footage they're like dude post that [ __ ] because it's going to help their brand PGA is old white guy [ __ ] and it's I get it that it's Antiquated so some of the younger guys were like [ __ ] this I want more freedom and fun I want something different some of them their careers are on the other side so they might not be making so much more twin money right so this is a great alternative the problem people had was like Dustin Johnson or you know guys that are at the top and they're like why are you pulling your game over there you could do you think you you think you can't win anymore in this which is part of the controversy it's like oh what's the big controversy the big controversy the Saudis yeah but but but Saudi money is invested in tons of [ __ ] look up uh look up look up Saudi look up Saudi money LPGA look that up uh the sa the the investment of the Saudis isn't like a new thing in American Sports so it's this is people are just mad because the PGA particularly is mad because they look they're looking something in the face that's threatening them it's not going to be bigger than the PGA but it's an alternative that's fun people like it I it's not going to be bigger it's not going to take it over but they don't what people are concerned with is that people are leaving and they're going to work for someone who's been accused of some horrific [ __ ] sure but who made your jeans these are American jeans but you know what I mean it's like most people made by origin but most people go oh dude I don't like that it's like you're made your [ __ ] shirt was made by a Chinese kid there's a lot well your phone if you're complaining about stuff you're literally complaining on a device that was made by slaves well that's my point so I think that when somebody when you start to get into the nitpicky stuff I'm always like I understand the idea of like being like people are anti them playing for Saudi money but you if you think you're not involved in Saudi money at a High Sports level I'm sorry but it's there well the WWE fans are freaking out now right why Jamie yeah yeah what's that about came out last night that the Saudi Investment fund bought the WWE I believe okay well what are you going to do what happens now I don't know yeah I don't this [ __ ] no what happens now well there's no Divas there's there not going to be any women look at that Vince McMahon WWE Talent done if company is sold to Saudi Arabia wrestling says it's not sold to Saudi according to them this is what was happening on Twitter last night Twitter WWE Twitter World freaked out it was like trending all night go to SNES what a Snopes have to say oh they had an answer oh they yeah is WWE being so research in progress oh still going so yes so the answer is yes and they just can't leak it yes the money comes around if it's it's a substantial increase in money I think here's the deal I understand tradition but if these guys want an Alterna League to play in who who [ __ ] let him go play I don't who gives a [ __ ] I don't know why do you need a monopoly of one League I mean you look at the history that's not what the problem is what what people have a problem with is Jamal kogi Jamal kogi who was a journalist for the Washington Post who was dismembered at the Turkish Embassy at the supposedly at the instructions of the Saudi royals he was critic critical of them yeah but I mean I don't know man I don't know who and I don't know who who literally is funding they could be just Saudi businessmen that are funding live I don't know this particulars but I don't know that's what I'm saying is like whatever if they want to go play in that league and they're comfortable with it let them go play I guess [ __ ] it what an American perspective well let them go play it's [ __ ] capitalism baby you want to get that [ __ ] check dude that's the Trump perspective get that [ __ ] check dude Trump told them it's an amazing amazing organization they're doing great things doing great things go get that money I think honestly here's what's really going to happen they're going to go get that money and then they're going to leave then it's going to be over and it's going to dissipate into nothing or not if they have that kind of cheddar they have enough cheddar they could literally keep this going forever if they wanted to and they wouldn't put a dentum no no it's not that and you're right it's more that what guys are going to be willing to either stay there or continue to go over there so the problem is the talent right it's like anything else it's like but they're having the events here correct I went to one so you don't have to stay you don't have to go over there I don't I don't think they only I I think they only play one over there all all of them are here like I went to in Chicago Rich Harvest Farms uh and yeah I mean I you know look it's it's really interesting to to see the internal uproar which I immediately attribute to golf is an old tradition sport so people are really particular so they don't even like that someone's entering the conversation the out the other perspective obviously is the one that is the bigger deal is people are people are think it's an immoral move unethical move if it was instead some enormous hedge fund got together and they put all their money together and decided to fund their own alternative golf agency golf tour just as mad I think they' be just as upset people would be the PJ does not want competition they don't like that guys are even thinking about going and then I think personally they're shoehorning in the Saudi stuff to go and that's bad see they're more mad about business interest they don't give a they don't [ __ ] care about how much of a effect is it having on the top players no I mean there my buddy my buddy's doing a documentary that's coming out on Netflix uh I think coming up soon in the first quarter of the Year about um the PGA and during it during the middle of the filming half of the guys left and went to live and he films both perspectives so and it's supposed to be really good it's just it's not changed much what's the the highest level player the high the highest level level like a guy who's like a championship caliber Phil Michelson is one of the greatest of all time arguably in a in a span of many many golfers I'm not saying he's like number one or I'm not saying I'm just saying he is one of the best of all time and he is the I think he's the biggest money right wasn't he the biggest him or D yeah him or DJ got the most but what kind of money are we talking about 150 mil supposedly to just come over to play before they won any extra money before they got paid out whoa yeah but that's also part of a contract that no one knows the details of these contracts well they're private right they don't have to disclose didn't they lose all their sponsors once they went over there though a lot of them a lot of them lost some of their sponsors but uh I don't know if you need him anymore after 150 mil clears right yeah I think I think like what kind of sponsors are we talking about CDW you know like business investment firms golf is sponsored heavily by like you know TD amera trade and [ __ ] that a lot of that which makes sense because all those guys the guys who like golf yeah that's who likes golf businessmen old businessmen they love to do business meetings on the golf course good to see you Phil I bet if you're like a businessman you probably have to play golf some circles it's an advantage I don't know if for the new era I you know my you know our age is what's going on now in the Youth of business I don't [ __ ] know what 22- year olds have to do to like get through in the corporate world but I imagine uh it's still a part of it to a degree you know it's an inner circle that you're going to get leverage from some way or it's like going to a good school it's like dude I went to Arizona state did I have any connections I made zero [ __ ] friends I made a lot of [ __ ] friends but none of them could help me business Wise It's not like going to Yale no yeah you go to you go to an accredited University someone's daddy is a somebody and so that's a big advantage in going to a good SCH you meet that guy and you might want up working for his firm he might give you a [ __ ] job yeah you want a job does your does your kid want a it's like that [ __ ] but Billy's a good kid really good kid and he's top of his class I'll give him a couple hundred grand a year out of school we'll let him [ __ ] off for two years then we'll figure it out show him how to do Coke we'll give him a bump but so I think like at the end of the day whatever whatever people whatever those guys want to do I just want to watch golf so I don't give a [ __ ] I'm defin the PJ is still going to be the number one because it has you know the Masters it has tournaments where you're it's it's just now is this the general attitude of most people most people are just letting it go they don't care people outraged most guys my age I think Jamie might be in a similar boat where you're like I don't [ __ ] give a [ __ ] but my dad's generation is like [ __ ] it's ridic you you don't that supporting the [ __ ] Saudis and you go over there and you're Bing the ship that like you sailed in on you know the PJ built you and it Formed you it would be like if the UFC had a big competitive had a had a competitive thing come forward with way more money which I don't know if that's happened I'm ignorant you could tell me if it has but it hasn't but if it had that that's kind of the same thing where people there's some guys who get really good deals that they wouldn't get in the UFC so what happens is um if there's Talent that's available that's Top Flight Talent uh Bellator has options you know that's an option A lot of guys will go to Bellator cuz Bellator will pay them more but it's like when you get to the world championship like the Conor McGregor khabib n mmed off level I think they make more money in the UFC right I think because they have pay-per-view excuse me pay-per-view you don't see pay-per-view with Bellator I think they've done a couple pay-per-views I don't think they've been that successful whereas UFC does a pay-per-view every month right every month is an enormous pay-per-view there's world championship fights where you get the best of the best and everybody knows who they are it's like Q-tips NFL NBA like that's MMA at the the highest level right like you can get cotton swabs at CVS that aren't made by Q-tips you you're asking for Q-tips where's the Q-tips where's Kleenex yeah where's the kleenex and that I mean that's not even the best example right because the Q-tips that you know CVS that aren't Q-tips the cotton swabs are probably just as good it's not that [ __ ] hard to have a little stick and little cotton on the end of it the name to get Elite world last fighters to compete in the biggest organization to hold that UFC belt you know and have Bruce Buffer say and no you know and they put that [ __ ] strap on you whoa that's the the cream of the crop when it comes to Combat Sports well that's what it is in the PGA it's like they hold tradition they're they've got it by the balls so no one will there's no uh it's not accredited you know live is for fun it's for money and fun and I think they're trying to appeal to like a a new Young Market I think they need to do that [ __ ] with the crowd that well the Liv is Liv has live music they have like it's who has that that one with the crowd what that's a different that's the PGA that's the PGA yeah this has got to be the this is like the one time they kind of let this chaos go it's cuz it's in Phoenix Waste Management runs it listen it's a great move no it's it's well you should show him a picture of what the 16th hole looks like without those stands it the what what they build is mindblowing the course outside of that looks nothing like that they build this huge structure that structure they put in temporarily yeah that's gone most of the time it's not there that's what it looks like that enormous structure they built temporarily yes and they keep it or they take it down just for the tournament they take it down the moment the tournament's closed that course goes back to what it looked look at the 16th without it oh my God that's insane or 17 is it how many people are in there I mean dude that's got to be I don't know thousands 5 thousand more looks like more that was a show that we were doing together we'd be like bro just without grand stand right without grand stand that looks like 30 40,000 to me man look at that's what it looks like Joe without it whoa it's nothing as a time lapse how many uh people were there Google the uh what's the the amount the audience size they you're allowed to walk in and out of that area it's not like you need a seat yeah you don't stay you can go anywhere on the course the whole day right but how many people get seated by those that that structur they put in place how many seats are available take a guess I'm saying 40 Grand I would say 20K yeah it's like 15,000 15 or 20K is my it seems more than that man it do soig there's a lot of boxes too they sell those boxes it's a 16 to they sell those boxes because people now know how fun it is right but what's the actual number I don't know that we'll know it it changes year to year because they add more people it's yeah but they have okay let's go the 2021 Waste Management open crowd size yeah that's yeah there's got to be a way to find it right 100% I mean they they'll give you they'll give you an estimate of something they'll give you like usually how many people show up because they brag about it 20,000 20,000 but that's like the whole event that's not sitting in yeah but I would argue half of them are there yeah that's probably 10 10 grand maybe but what a great idea to get it exciting cuz that was so much more exciting than a normal golf when they interview pro golfers this is only 5,000 th000 fans per day that was 2021 this is when the pandemic was happening the grand stands are non-existent uh pro golfers say that that's the most nervous they are because people are it's people talk [ __ ] they're yelling it's dude it's most times you know they get this as a guy that holds up a thing to shut the [ __ ] up yeah there there's no rules you just can't love that and you know what's so funny when somebody does get a hole in one like that they all throw beer like you can he's got pictures of it where they'll throw beer on there but they don't get kicked out or anything like the one time you're allowed to throw beer","The transcript centers on a conversation about the LIV Golf League, backed by Saudi funds, and how it relates to traditional golf institutions like the PGA. There's an enthusiastic embrace of the LIV concept, praised for providing more freedom and alternative opportunities for golfers, particularly those constrained by the PGA's traditional hold on contracts and footage rights. The discussion delves into the criticism of LIV Golf due to Saudi Arabia's notorious human rights record and its association with Jamal Khashoggi's murder. However, the host argues that Saudi investments are prevalent in many American institutions and suggests that outrage may partly stem from the PGA's loss of monopolistic control. The dialogue also touches on the WWE's rumored sale to the Saudi Investment Fund, treating it lightly. Comparisons are made with UFC and its competition, pointing out that alternative leagues tend to offer attractive financial deals, even if they don’t deliver the prestige of the established leagues. The conversation waveringly takes both sides but tends to favor the new opportunities offered by LIV, despite ethical concerns. There's a discussion about the appeal of these events, like the LIV promoting new, engaging golf experiences even if traditionalists might resist. The sentiment generally acknowledges capitalism's role in facilitating these ventures, suggesting that major culture shifts in sports are welcomed by younger spectators willing to sidestep traditional barriers.",Sportswashing,0,Yes,LIV Golf,Saudi Arabia
nuGBJOq_aCI,Why the LIV golf series is so controversial - BBC News,a golf tournament funded by saudi arabia is asking questions of how the sport is run and what if anything the sport stands for at the centurion course in the south of england some of the world's best players have gathered it's an exciting time i think it's exciting for the game of golf and i'm excited to be a part of it excitement all round and this is a series of eight tournaments aimed we're told at giving players more freedom live golf has given them the opportunity for another pathway to to be the independent contractors go play where they need to play when they want to play for more money former world number one greg norman is the public face of live golf its tournaments will last 54 holes not the traditional 72 and former world number two phil mickelson has called that a progressive format progressive though isn't the word often used about saudi arabia as its critics point out what we're talking about here are severe extensive persistent human rights abuses in saudi arabia and while freedom is being offered to golfers it's not on offer to some saudis the us government says there are credible reports of forced disappearances tortured by government agents executions for non-violent offences it also notes that women continue to face discrimination and that there is arbitrary arrest and detention then there's the killing of the saudi journalist demar khasaji in 2018 he walked into the saudi consulate in istanbul he was then murdered his body was dismembered his remains have never been located the saudi government called it a rogue operation by its agents but u.s intelligence concluded that crown prince mohammed bin salman approved an operation in istanbul to capture or kill jamal kasoji and this was the un's conclusion the responsibility of the state of saudi arabia is involved it is involving the killing it is involving the lack of an effective investigation it is involved in the lack of an effective prosecution the state was involved says the un and mohammed bin salman was in charge of that state then he's in charge of it now he's also chair of the saudi investment fund which is bankrolling this golf series and in the view of the washington post what we're seeing is a government trying to use golf to cleanse its global reputation or amnesty international says it's yet one more event in a series of sports washing exercises that the saudi authorities are using to clean its blood-soaked image and bbc's dan rowan tried to raise these concerns with the governor of the saudi investment fund it's the big thing in golf and we're going to enjoy it that's why i'm here i'm going to play the pro um and i'm going to have full of hopefully fun mr ruby yan is hoping to have fun but dan had one more question let's ask you very quickly about the suggestions of sports watching what do you say to that what's your response i'm really not sure about this terminology mr rumayan said he'd look it up meanwhile we still wait on a formal explanation of why saudi arabia is doing this we do know it as a strategy to unfold new opportunities for non-oil gdp growth that push to find revenue away from oil is real perhaps golf is part of that and whatever the saudi goal would live golf program dao is happy to help if saudi arabia want to use the game of golf as as a way for them to get to where they want to be and they have the resources to accelerate that experience you know i think we're we're proud to help them on that journey graeme mcdowell is proud though as we've heard the experience for some saudis is rather better for some than others and when greg norman was asked about jamal khashoggi's murder he replied look we've all made mistakes and you just want to learn from those mistakes and how you can correct them going forwards but not everyone has made those mistakes the u.s and the u.n don't even think it was a mistake and jamal khashoggi's fiance has said of those golfers working with the saudis how can we go forward when those who ordered the murder are still unpunished and continue to try to buy back their legitimacy the players though are going forward phil mickelson's playing and back in february he talked about the saudis saying if you'll allow me to paraphrase their scary so-and-so's to get involved with he went on we know they kill kasoji and have a horrible record on human rights they execute people over there for being gay knowing all of this why would i even consider it he asked why indeed will he clear that up adding because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to reshape how the pga tour operates the chance to overhaul the administration of gold from the u.s was despite those reservations too good to pass up mickelson apologized for what he said took a break from golf but he's back at the tournament i don't condone human rights violations at all i i don't think nobody here does any throughout the world and i'm certainly aware of what has happened with jamal khashoggi and it's i think it's terrible terrible says phil nicholson and he also outlined the upsides of working with the state that the un concluded was responsible i've also seen the good that the game of golf has done throughout history and i believe that live golf is going to do a lot of good for the game as well golfers are forced for the greater good it's not yet clear how that will work inside saudi arabia certainly though live golf could be a force for good for those wanting to change how pro golf is organized as the bbc's ian carter explains professional golf is effectively a pyramid and at the very top of that pyramid are two main tours the european tour which is now known as the dp world tour and the pga tour based in the united states that's where the very best players play and each year they're competing for an excess of 400 million dollars to take on that system the saudis are offering huge sums this first event has prize money of 25 million dollars it's the most lucrative golf tournament in history the winner takes 4 million for comparison the top prize at the masters this year was 2.7 million dollars the promise of more money has proved persuasive for some dustin johnson lee westwood sergio garcia and ian poulter all huge stars of the game will play this is lee westwood's reason this is my job i do this for money and it's not the only reason for doing it you know but you know if anybody comes along and gives any of us a a chance of a pay rise then you have to seriously consider it don't you he has considered it and he's decided to play and he'll be far from the only sports star to benefit from saudi money there's a 600 million dollar deal with formula one 400 million dollars went for a controlling stake in newcastle football club and now over two billion dollars will go to golf in the coming years and the players who take the money know it may affect where they can play here's ian carter again pro golfers like to think of themselves as independent contractors but the reality is that if they are playing on a tour they have obligations to it and if they want to play for a rival well they have to apply for a waiver that's exactly what they did when live golf came calling and the tours said no the tours said no but greg norman has kept making the case this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to unlock the potential for the game of golf to truly grow it's only a chance for the players bank balances to grow and for saudi arabia to pursue its goals for golf more broadly we'll see and as the series began it tweeted shot just got real indeed it did as we see golfers trying to explain where if at all they draw the line if vladimir putin had a tournament would you play that that's speculation can't not even going to comment on speculation no comment on that question and in their own different ways the golfers have been making this point we're not politicians i know you guys hate that expression but you know we're really not unfortunately back in maylie westwood said i don't think sport and politics should mix that may be the hope but sport and politics frequently do and whether the players want to be political or not by stepping onto the first tee the players are choosing to work directly with saudi arabia given its human rights record that choice unavoidably has a political dimension you,"The transcript discusses a golf tournament funded by Saudi Arabia, scrutinizing its implications on the sport and the accusations of sportswashing associated with it. At the Centurion Club in England, some of the world's top players, such as Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson, have gathered for this event, which brings excitement and higher prize money, offering golfers more freedom and independence as contractors. The tournaments, branded as LIV Golf, are spearheaded by Greg Norman and promise a more progressive format with 54 holes instead of the traditional 72.",Sportswashing,-1,No,LIV Golf,Saudi Arabia

The merger also includes the PGA European Tour, collectively forming a for-profit entity that will benefit from the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF). PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan recognized the previous tensions due to the PIF's influence but argued that the merger was necessary to unify the golf community. Tensions had escalated when LIV Golf, supported by PIF, attracted some of the PGA's top players, leading to legal battles including antitrust lawsuits filed by prominent golfers like Phil Mickelson against the PGA, with LIV joining the suit. The new entity will have a board with a majority appointed by the PGA, and PIF retains exclusive rights for future investments. Despite the merger, criticisms remain regarding Saudi Arabia's human rights record and the perception that the PGA sold out for financial gain. The narrative presents two contrasting views: one from the PGA, which sees the merger as beneficial, promoting global golf outreach with Saudi investment, and another from Esquire magazine, accusing the PGA of betraying its athletes and fans for Saudi money without accountability for human rights issues.",Sportswashing,-1,No,LIV Golf,Saudi Arabia
gspb4DSvgm8,Tooning Out Crashes Saudi-Backed LIV Golf Tournament,I'm big News host James smartwood and I'm reporting from the live golf tournament at the Orange County National Golf Course in Florida's Florida Orlando the live golf league is financed by The Sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia whose chairman is Muhammad bin Salman who if he's watching is a great leader who did not order the execution of American journalist Jamal khashoggi now some say the Saudis want to sportswash their reputation for being soulless and money obsessed and so to counter that narrative they've started a soulless and money obsessed Golf League here are the world's top players with bottomless morals compete for the most coveted prize in sports something some marketing guy made up a week ago unlike the PGA the live golf league consists of 12 teams each with four players who and I quote the Saudi rule book may not touch penises punishable by death live golf's motto is golf but louder and Promises a party atmosphere featuring alcohol and music so loud Phil Mickelson can barely hear his frantic screaming bookie I was denied a press pass after I refused to agree to never mention Saudi Arabia so I had to buy a ticket like everyone else that's right under no circumstances James smart would be bought unless the price is right let's go inside and see if I come out but first I needed to prepare alright I got everything I need to cover the Saudis here my trusty notebook tape recorder and my not press Flak Jacket hopefully the sniper can see that from afar journalist Jamal khashoggi was dismembered using a bone saw so I took a couple calcium supplements to firm up my bones they're the metal detectors to detect anyone bringing in uh any weapons and a microwave their 911 memories wow beautiful course way better than their first idea of watching Mickelson in a big empty field chasing a dollar taped to a golf cart okay here's how they get you the fine print attendees also assume liability for injuries incurred while being sliced and diced by Death Squad oh my God I think that's MBS yeah that's him look at this there it is love to bone saw we're here at Fan Village also known as bribery row here is the live golf simulator which allows fans to simulate the experience of being a professional live golfer just the golf part not the part where you thrash run in bed asking God for forgiveness the only aspect of this live golf simulator that is missing is taking a call from your agent telling you you just lost another sponsor this party's got everything a DJ well there's someone having fun nope he works here I mean sure our energy security is important to our economic growth but shouldn't we draw a line somewhere when a trade partner is violating International norms anyway can you play Cha-Cha Slide here's the Impact Zone where they talk about their commitment to fighting climate change what a vision and it all starts with printing up a sign and ends there too the show they're serious about climate change they're already recycling the most vapid phrases imaginable there it is the Kid Zone Florida the only state where it's supposedly more dangerous for kids to go to a drag show than be in the care of the Saudi government oh look at these about playing Putt-Putt because there's nowhere else to play putt-putt in Orlando without giving money to death squads ah man look at this someone's gonna slip on a journalist finger here we are at the golf course the tournament is an historic event these fans will never forget even though never forgetting historic events clearly isn't their strong suit sure it was strange to hang around a tournament tied up with a bloodthirsty theocracy but no one said America was perfect let's meet some of the players there's Phil Mickelson looking to press because he bet two million dollars that it'd be windy today there's Australian golfer cam Smith he's guilt-free because since Australia is below the equator the 911 planes went out of the buildings that's Bubba Watson who's famously long back swing gives him more time to come up with reasons why this whole thing isn't weird hey impalter good luck today God forbid you lose and only make 10 million dollars Dustin did you join live golf to provide for your poor starving family of Gretzky heiresses here's the leaderboard nice to read something involving Saudi Arabia that isn't redacted first place is that guy second is him third is whoever that is fourth is who gives a but they're all winners because they set up their children for life with blood money that is actually not a sand trap that is a journalist ashes I don't see any officials in the Saudis Sovereign wealth fund I assume they're weirded out with how conservative Florida is another journalist's finger they must be using these as teas or something the tournament was packed with fans who love sports but don't care for the whole any sense of meaning part obviously a lot of great live golf league teams the swingy dingers the ball Slammers the swingies the plumps splunks meeps squirts blurps rum diggity's plurps vacuum bags boobs wobs the blobs and who's your favorite Cleveland

but yeah don't blink is cool too hell yeah you having a good time River DC baby all day every day that's awesome all right let's talk about 9 11. a wound in the collective psyche the American

firefighters got so much exercise that day so many lung cancer doctors put their kids through college what do you think absolutely yeah way too harsh Ripper GC yeah I love those guys it was also a long time ago so a lot of time ago at some point you have to forgive you know did you ever find it weird that they teach the ball to take off but not how to land how did you have fun yeah oh that's

Firefighters obviously it raises a lot of questions when golf clubs are close together so the Saudis are selling this super heterosexual golf topper after a day of reporting on the tournament and saying the word Saudi is not 11 a thousand times I went back to my hotel room where I took some precautions in case the Saudis had bugged my room my favorite country oh that has to be Saudi Arabia I

God oh my God oh my God oh my God oh my God oh my God oh my God I returned to the tournament the next day only this time it was time to party all right here we are at the birdie Shack nothing beats getting drunk standing a 90 degree heat and watching some guy stare at a hole here's their signature drinks menu let's take a look at this Pinot gaze aloud gim didn't let women drive until 2018 smoldering Manhattan screwdriver to a journalist head oh that looks good as I took in the music and drinks and saw how much they offered Charles Barkley to be a broadcaster I wondered who am I to judge I'm not so perfect maybe I bone sought a journalist and don't even remember I drink milk from the garden and I'm judging them for beheading gay people I decided I wanted to be a live broadcaster all I had to do now was find the CEO Greg Norman Mr Norman Miss Norman nope Mr Norman is that you no it's Norman over here I hope that's not him nope nope nope nope nope oh wow two Greg Normans nope nope that's the opposite of Greg Norman I started to think that I would never find Greg Norman but then the opposite happened I found him there he is the CEO of liftgolf Greg Norman watching the action through the dollar signs on his eyeballs sure the rating are low and the competition is uninspired but at least everyone hates him I for want him shocked that this billion dollar live golf business is suffering despite leadership by a man good at using a stick to hit a ball in a hole I was ready to approach him but then I got a call Hey Dad it's junior smartwood junior yeah I know you are a junior right anyways I figured out how to shave really and you didn't die oh I'm bleeding a lot I'm standing on a pile of red paper towels anyways I just wanted to say that I respect you a lot and always will unless you sell out to an autocracy for money why do you say that yeah that might be the excessive blood loss talking and where do we keep the Band-Aids [Music] after hearing Junior's words and realizing that due to the Florida heat my suit smelled like a diaper I decided not to beg Greg Norman for a job [Music] today we have witnessed The Impossible a journalist has survived seeing a critical word about the Saudi government congratulations to me though I'd run up quite a lot of financial debts on the Assumption I would not come home alive and congratulations to the winners the floppers or whatever on defeating their opponents who must now lick their wounds over a seven course meal at Nobu and now I will go sit on a plane sweating profusely as I beg the pilot to take off from tuning out the news this is James smartwood whereas I will now be known to evade capture Greg Hall foreign [Music],"The transcript is a satirical and critical commentary on the LIV Golf tournament, which is financially backed by the Saudi Arabian Sovereign Wealth Fund. The host, James Smartwood, humorously critiques the event by highlighting the perceived disconnect between the tournament's opulent and frivolous nature and the serious human rights issues associated with Saudi Arabia, including the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The tournament is portrayed as an effort in sportswashing to improve Saudi Arabia's global reputation while ignoring ethical concerns. The humor is centered around the absurdity of the event's extravagance and how it masks underlying geopolitical and ethical controversies. References to Saudi Arabia's role in 9/11 and their human rights record are made, using dark humor to underscore the severe issues being overshadowed by the sporting event. The narrative suggests a critical view of those who participate or condone the sportswashing, while remarking on the irony of trying to make golf ""loud"" and entertaining to distract from these controversies.",Sportswashing,-1,No,LIV Golf,Saudi Arabia

IF WE GET THE POINTS EVERYTHING ELSE TAKES CARE OF ITSELF. BRIAN: EVERYONE I","The transcript revolves around the controversial launch of the LIV Golf Tour, spearheaded by Greg Norman, which has attracted significant attention due to its financial backing from the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF). This fund has billions in assets and is often associated with ""baggage,"" likely referencing Saudi Arabia's contentious reputation regarding human rights and other issues. Greg Norman expressed understanding of the strong emotions from the PGA Tour, which reacted by suspending 17 golfers who joined LIV. Norman described the LIV Golf Tour's business model as well-researched and intended to benefit both players and fans by offering better financial opportunities and flexibility. He sees the Saudi investment as a ""force for good,"" citing previous collaborations between Saudi Arabia and other golf organizations. Despite criticism labeling the Saudi funds as ""blood money,"" Norman argued against such claims, highlighting existing investments linking the PGA Tour and Saudi entities. He suggested that suspending players but allowing Saudi-sponsored tournaments within the PGA demonstrates hypocrisy. The transcript further discusses Norman's attempts to foster coexistence between the tours and his efforts to obtain official points for LIV Golf, asserting that the league has taken steps to apply for rankings despite potential institutional resistance.",Sportswashing,-1,No,LIV Golf,Saudi Arabia
ZQwFsV3vk54,Jack Nicklaus LASHES OUT At LIV Golf.. Here’s Why,Oh Yeah from Rory mroy to Tiger Woods there are many golfers strictly against the Liv tour but this time it was Jack Nicholas who spoke up against it he said that the tour was buying the game it's been some time since the Liv tour first came into existence and I know it seems like things have calmed down since then but I feel like it's mostly because everyone had had their say they've already given their opinion time and time again that uh what they've done is they they've turned their back on what has allowed them to get to this position um and now there isn't much left to do but it looks like Jack is a bit behind everyone else because just recently he resurfaced to criticize the Saudi back tour Jack is an incredible golfer who managed to win 18 majors and you know what makes him even more legendary he's probably the only golfer who has won more Majors than Tiger Woods so I guess whatever this guy has to say is pretty valid the former golfer wasn't happy about the large amount of money Liv was paying its golfers not because he didn't think they didn't deserve it but because it was so obvious they were just trying to buy the game a hor it's a great four it's been over a year since Liv's emergence and let me tell you this isn't the first time people have complained about the high salaries of golfers but unlike the rest of them Jack doesn't fault the golfers that deflected well to say that they deflected is a bit of an exaggeration that's just the thought of the Loyalists golfers who are obsessed with the PGA according to them joining the live was a huge insult to golf itself betrayal is a very strong word uh I think it it it's disappointing I think the the the players that have decided to and they started calling these people Rebels soon enough there was talk about how they couldn't stand these people or stomach the thought of playing next to them and all this drama caused a rift in golf which will apparently take years to recover from and will bring with it a new age of golf and this is what led to the Gulf War while the worst of it has calmed down things are far from going back to normal and people from both sides are still going up against each other I'm just looking at live golf and where we are today to where we were six seven months ago and people are saying this is dead in the water and we're we're past that and here we are today uh a force in the game that's not going away that uh the Liv are against the extreme loyalty some golers have towards PGA and how they're intent on the fact that just because it came first it's the face and future of the gulf in turn the people from the PGA Tour are always on about how they're supporting the violation of human rights in my opinion both sides are just trying to do their job play golf earn money and live a successful and satisfactory life the people who went to the live just took the easy way out and for some reason the PGA loyalists are extremely salty at that because let me tell you they aren't happy about the live golfers excessive paydays I mean they're being paid a bit too much they probably get paid more in one year than PGA golfers do in a decade or more he only needs one Brooks cap four time major winner but really to say that these people and their careers don't matter just because they chose a luxurious life for themselves is a bit too much and not only for themselves these people have families too wives and Children Of course going for large amounts of money without a second thought isn't a good thing but we can't say all of these people are greedy Jack is of the same opinion he doesn't fault the ones who chose to play for the live the 83-year-old said that they were given a choice it was between playing golf for sometime earn a lot of money collect it keep it for their family or staying in PGA staying loyal to right regular golf then go straight to the senior tour and then finally retirement not as easy or luxurious as the live golfers but definitely satisfactory they took the first option it's easier for them and they made their call but Jack did admit that while this was perfect for the players in the long- term it wouldn't end well for the game he said that he wasn't a big fan of the way the PGA Tour was forced to react it's not an issue for me because I don't work for the Saudi Arabian government but it probably is an issue for players that chose to go and take that money and I think you have to ask yourself the question Jim why the Liv tour is kind of like a secondary tour within the main one a second layer but in the end Jack stated that he was more than willing to go with the flow there's a loyalty that's built up with a lot of our guys here and they didn't have that and and I I can see that they have an opportunity to uh do something for their families that uh they're probably not going to be able to do on on a regular tour okay maybe that's an exaggeration but he did say that times change and he'll have to deal with it in the end all of this depends on how the legal cases are handled a lot of live golfers have brought the fact that they aren't earning world ranking points to court and the end result of these court cases will be the future of Liv right now though as far as people are concerned they're still trying to get a seat at the table obviously it's not sitting with with people and why wouldn't it the PGA Tour has been around for years nobody likes Outsiders shaking up their Camp Nicholas thinks live is getting ahead of themselves he thinks they're using money to buy the game and just want to buy respect and loyalty it's not how things work you can't buy what you have to earn and Nicholas agrees he mentioned he didn't think that's what it's all about and someone gave a pretty good analogy and it'll hurt basically people think the live Camp just wants to sit on a veranda at Augusta National and sip mint julips with the membership and then they expect people to accept them he thinks they're trying to gain entrance into the main frame of golf Nicholas has enjoyed a pretty remarkable career with a whopping 118 titles and get this 73 of them came from the PGA Tour it explains why he's so fond of them he even holds the record for the most Majors one on the tour but one thing's for sure he repaid the favor with impressive loyalty the star was offered an eye popping amount of cash over £80 million in two separate offers he rejected both of them he thinks he needs to play for the game Nicholas insisted that money wasn't the reason he was a player it was a bit out of the ordinary after all prize money has been on the rise in the Golf Scene he mentioned that back when he was in his prime he just did what I did he said that he just won a few tournaments and didn't get much money even if they thought it was a lot then he went on to say that his lifetime time earnings would add up to around $8 million and 10 guys make that figure these days he obviously didn't think that things would change to such an extreme extent one day Nicholas said that there was a lot to be said about today's age in golf but he wouldn't trade what he did he loved what he did and we admire the love he has for his sport he thinks times have changed and golf isn't what it once was Nicholas and his fellow players played for the sport not the money he said that money was just something they got as a side benefit something they won on the course it's not that it wasn't necessary since they needed to make a living so they could continue to play what they loved but it wasn't the end all be all for them Nicholas doesn't like what golf has become today in his opinion the guys on the course today play for the money not the game we can see why he feels that way when we look at a legendary veteran who gave his life to golf and compare it to people changing sides for money it's obvious it wouldn't sit well with him so here's what Jack Nicholas had to say about live buying golf,"The transcript explores Jack Nicklaus's critical perspective on the LIV Golf Tour, backed by Saudi investment. Initially, Nicklaus critiques the LIV Tour for its significant financial allure, suggesting it aims to ""buy the game"" and gain unearned respect within the golf community. Despite the widespread acceptance and stabilization of LIV Golf's existence, tensions persist between traditionalists loyal to the PGA Tour and those who joined LIV for lucrative offers. Nicklaus acknowledges the players' motivations to join LIV, especially for familial and financial reasons, yet he regrets the potential long-term impact on golf's integrity. He highlights his own era's ethos, emphasizing playing for love of the sport rather than monetary gain, contrasting it with the current landscape where financial incentives dominate. Nicklaus, loyal to the PGA Tour during his career, rejected sizeable offers from LIV, underlining his commitment to the sport over money. He concedes that while times have changed, golf's essence has shifted towards commercialism. The transcript reflects an ongoing tension in golf, with concerns of sports integrity versus financial opportunities, portraying Nicklaus as a figure championing traditional values.",Sportswashing,-1,No,LIV Golf,Saudi Arabia
dqqgE85y6rM,"""Rory McIlroy, Don't Begrudge Other Players!"" Greg Norman Debates LIV Golf With Piers Morgan",one of the biggest controversies in World sport right now involves the Saudi Bank live golf tour which in the words of star Rory mcilroy's ripped golf apart it's lured a series of superstars with Untold riches and taken a lot of criticism for supposedly whitewashing the image of the Saudi Arabian government golfing Legend Greg Norman is The Man Behind the live tour and he joins Me Now Greg great to talk to you yeah thank you pierce thanks for having me on so look I'm heading up to the Alfred Dunhill Lynx Championship which is one of the biggest pro-ams as well as the main tournament in the world I'm going to be surrounded and maybe playing with one of the top PGA players and I've got to say as a golf fan who loves Golf and loves watching top golfers this split in the sport is quite heartbreaking and I guess my first question to you is how does this all resolve itself do you think well I think over a period of time it will resolve itself peers there's no question about it um look in a let's just clarify this split I think the split or this animosity has only come from one side of The Ledger quite honestly one thing we have really shown case is that the golf is a Force for good right and competition is really fantastic for any part of any business any sport even in your profession competition is fantastic for you so what we've done is just put another competitive platform for the independent contractors which is us which we've always been I believe independent contractors have a choice and have a right to go somewhere else and play the game golf appears the whole thing about what we've done with live we built the entire system from the ground up to work within the ecosystems we tried to reach out with the European tour we tried to reach out with the PGA Tour we wanted to integrate ourselves within their system to show that what we have is additive to the to the sport of golf and so we've just decided that our product has stood up the test of time in a very short period of time in 12 rounds of golf the players love it the fans love it so we've just decided to go ahead and launch and you know we've like I said we've given the opportunity to work with the PGA Tour to talk to the PGA Tour but they made the decision not us when you hear someone like Rory McIlroy he's one of the top players in the world right now without any question and a very you know a passionate and eloquent defender of the PGA Tour when you hear how scathing he is about what you're doing what is your what's your message to him well my message is Rory you're an independent contractor you have the right to make your decision remember Rory started on the European tour then Rory decided to leave the European tour to go play where where all the money is where I went to play to the PGA Tour why did we do that pierce we did that because that was the only option we had as players we had to go sign on to their rules and regulations we couldn't even negotiate their rules and regulations so we had to do the only thing we could possibly do is play the tour what we've done now is give them options hey Rory happy days do what he wants to do you know if he's comfortable over there doing that he's an independent contractor he can if Rory wants to go to the Middle East and get appearance money to play in tournaments Happy Days go play in those Rory that's your choice don't begrudge the other players for making the decision that is a rightful decision under their independent contract or rights to go do it it's just a shame that people have taken this stance when you if you look back over a period of time they're pretty much done the same thing themselves do you think that it's about morality or money and the reason I asked that is I actually wrote a column for the New York Post about what I thought was the hypocrisy about a lot of the sports washing debate in the sense that the Saudis already have a Formula One Grand Prix they they own a Premier League Football Club Newcastle they stage all the big boxing bats and that none of that gets anything like the kind of or program that you guys have had for setting up a Saudi sponsored golf tour and I don't understand what the distinction is I don't also understand how the PGA if they're being honest with themselves could say that they themselves never do business with regimes which wouldn't hold up to much human rights scrutiny so I see a hypocrisy there what's your view about that look past you hit the nail on the head hypocrisy the hypocrisy coming out of this is so deafening it's ridiculous um because you're right the PGA Tour has title sponsors that have a great relationship and working relationship for a commercial opportunity with the Saudi government with pis whatever it is pif has done a lot of indirect and direct investment in a multitude of opportunities there's probably here in this country one third of this country are the benefactors of that so I don't understand why it is that way sadly I got an idea because we're the monopolists I mean we're going in challenging the monopolist which is a PGA Tour it's been the one place to play golf for the last 53 years all we've done it is come in and shown another opportunity another additive opportunity now for the players to make their decision oh my gosh I would have loved to have that decision in my day when I had the choice to go and play both tours appears we're not asking our guys the live guys just to play live and nowhere else in the world we're asking our guys we're giving them an opportunity you play here you can go play anywhere else in the world you want to go play we're not holding restricted covenances on you where you can't you don't have to get a release you can go do whatever you want to do and that's what I'm proud about I've given these players who then live the opportunity to grow their wealth and give give them the opportunity to go other places to play the argument against what you're doing as you know is that you're just throwing huge amounts of cash at the top players many of whom are taking it that the format of what you do is not as good as the PGA because you don't have a cut system there's no kind of losing if you like there's just equal you know different degrees of winning and also that at the moment you're not getting many people watching this the streams aren't getting much traction and that you need a network to actually take this to the next level do you think you're going to be able to achieve that and have you got networks you think you are going to rise above the Sport washing debate to do what you want to do well 100 Pierce 100 look going back to the money issue right we've been the leader you take live out of the equation the PGA Tour would never reacted the way they've reacted by increasing their pip increasing their 20 elevated events giving more money to the players this is what they should have been done in debt during decades and decades ago there are 501c6 their Charter is to promote professional tournament golfers right promote professional tournament golfers but here all of a sudden Liv comes along then all of a sudden all this money pops out about nowhere out of their Reserve how do you think the players feel that are either on the level of being you know decades and decades in the game of golf even me included saying why didn't I have the right to play for this money if you've had this in reserve all this period of time for just all of a sudden pop up out of nowhere because of live you've got to ask a lot of questions about that and these are the part of the things where you know from my perspective what we're producing with live we're a commercial entity we're investing in New in uh new value in the game of golf and Piers what is that new value it's the Virgin space that's been sitting there unidentified for years which is the team franchise value and the players love this opportunity they have embraced it they have loved the team spirit yes they play individual at the same time talking about your format but the players love the fact that they can play individually and they play as a team to see the camaraderie and the locker room and the way these guys interact week in week out it's 14 Ryder cups every year going from 2023 onwards only on the okay on the morality Point I've seen a lot of your players some handle it pretty well when they get asked about this others have not handled it so well some have been completely buried like Phil Mickelson which I think has been incredibly unfair actually and I'm sad to see a legend of the game like can be pilloried in the way that he has but they're obviously legitimate questions about the Saudi regime about the murder of the journalists khashoggi and so on you know even you when you've been asked Greg about these things have said things in by way of response which have led to criticism you know are you free because of your association with the Saudi government in this way are you free to be critical of their human rights records and so on look I mean here's what happened with khashoggi's reprehensible but what we're doing now is with golf in the game of golf what we're doing is showing golf is a Force for good across the world across all platforms we're reaching down we're reaching up we're creating a foundational base for this pyramid of opportunities going forward not just in the men's game of golf but we're looking at the pathways and opportunities we can do from Collegiate players I mean David Puig for example just termed professional and joined he was a US amateur guy he came up from those ranks we are giving these guys the opportunity through golf being the Force for good to be able to give them this Pathway to where they want to go so yeah look there's that side of the Ledger there's no question about it there's going to be questions no question about it but we are a commercial entity we're investing into the game of golf we're growing the game of golf and I'll say this peers I've been away involved with the game of golf for 45 years in that 45 years I have never seen another entity willing to step up to this to date and give us 22 billion dollars to invest into the game of golf I think that is a just a powerful Testament to the strength of the game of golf number one and the the opportunity as a as a commercial entity to get a Roi out of the game of golf it is it is beneficial to everybody and to see what it's done on a global basis I'm a golf Ambassador I have been in my other company traveling around the world building golf courses in different places around the world third world countries and to see what golf can do to open up countries to open up Hospitality education do whatever we need bring in the third party investment all those opportunities the game of golf delivers you we're seeing it happening right now but again you know coming back to my position as a fan I love playing golf I'm a ropey 16 handicapper but I love the sport and everything about it what I I really am struggling you only have to give me eight aside yeah exactly yeah um no but and I've loved watching you play over the years what I'm sad about right now is I you know you look at the major tournaments for example if your live golfers are not allowed to get ranking points and then they can't qualify for the majors they cease to be in my view proper Majors if you're going to have half the world's best players not able to compete they're not major tournaments are they similarly the Ryder Cup which I absolutely love you've actually got a split there between players on the PGA tour disagreeing with each other about what to do with that you've got Matt Fitzpatrick the US Open Champion saying he thinks that the Live players should be allowed to play you've got Rory saying the opposite What's Happening Here is tearing the very fabric of the game in two and I'm just again I come back to how how does this somehow get reconciled if you were predicting what you think is going to happen here where will we be in a year or two years time I look I ultimately believe there will be some merging of the the powers to be to sitting down having conversation we don't want it right now because we've tried and uh going back to what you were saying before we didn't create this turmoil we just came in with another opportunity for the ecosystem within the ecosystem for the players for the fans our Innovation and our evolution is second to none it is changing the way golf is viewed you imagine about the viewers right in production since we came out since February the September the 4th in Boston that moment in time that last hour of Television that you may or may not have seen that was exactly quintessential what liver's all about you've you've got four or five guys playing for the individual and you've got three or four or five teams playing for the the teams there was an hour of Epic television there was shots going left right in the center we people the fans see you know 50 more golf shots played on our format than anywhere else so we didn't really start this big fight we didn't create this animosity and with the Mages quite honestly peers they should be Switzerland right if I'm a major I want to have the best of the best in my field they're the four Super Bowls they're the four fa cups they're the four whatever you want to call them that should always remain up there Switzerland away from anybody for them to be dragged into this Quagmire yeah there's gonna be a lot of questions to be needed to be asked about that but they should be apart from that if you're a broadcaster of any of the four majors you should be saying to them we want the Live players in there because 26 out of the top 100 players right now today are Live players ow gr they've got to be again Switzerland because they're an independent organization there's 22 other tour events in this world that get ow gr points and I can tell you this 21 of 21 of those 22 are far inferior than what the live tourism you know it reminds me why are we being targeted right I mean in a way it reminds me a bit of what happened to my favorite sport cricket with Kerry Packer who I know you knew very well and when that first all started he was getting a lot of the heat that you're getting not for the same kind of reason but he was getting the same heat for destroying what people felt was a tradition of the game and of course we now have the IPL which is a hugely lucrative and popular series which really would never have happened I don't think with that Kerry Packer and his courage you yourself have gone under unbelievable fire you know you've been snubbed up at the open they wouldn't let you go to the Champions dinner which I thought was actually very churlish as a great golfing Champion a great sporting Champion how are you dealing with that kind of vitriol the kind of disenfranchisement from the sport and the official bodies that you that were once so welcomed by how are you on a personal level dealing with that um look be honest with you peers at times my heat shield gets a little bit weak because I am a human being I've done a lot for the game of golf I was number one player in the world for six years I've done things in the game of golf I've promoted the game of golf I've grown the game of golf globally I've took a mission on myself as an individual player to fly all around the world I was the first guy to do an exhibition match mainland China I was one of the first guys to go into the Middle East and do that and through my golf and business as at the same time I continued to do that so when they do these what happened in the RNA was a petty cheap childish shot be honest with you and if you can't Rise Above It All shame on you because if you were under the under pressure from other people exerting pressure on you shame on you for you not to sit down and have a discussion and to understand what the live business model is and to see how it sits within the ecosystem shame on you because in business and remember a commercial entity in business you understand what your Opera what your opponent's got you understand what your uh your competitors got unpack it all to see if you can actually work together within the system to make both entities better for each other not try and destroy us and we haven't tried to destroy the PGA worked very very closely to work with them have you lost personal friends in in the golf world as a result of all this a hundred percent I have yep but if they look if they want to judge me on uh lack of information and lack of what uh what's out there but they're they're the ones with the small mind right when you know the facts you understand the facts you understand the delivery mechanism and the business model peers let me say this my c-suite are the best of the best in the world of business the economists lawyers uh marketing they came from a diverse section of sport and business right knock golf why are they why do I have over a hundred of the best of the best in the business because of the business model and the business model is showing through the product they're showing through so I'm lucky to have these magnificent people behind me I'm lucky to have an investor willing to invest into the game of golf like they are investing golf is lucky to have this but do you and some people say great so what what people say they say do you have any moral line about any of this at all in the sense that I think some of your players were asked at a press conference well if Vladimir Putin wanted to set up a golf tour would you allow that to happen would you want to be involved in that in other words is there a moral line that Greg Norman wouldn't cross my moral line is I believe in the product my moral line is I've been a big storage composer of growing the game of golf on a global basis my moral line is golf is the Force for good so when you have this opportunity and I've seen it Pierce I've seen it Beyond live right prior to live I've seen what I've done in Vietnam I've seen what I've done in Mexico through my other businesses through Golf Course design it is so resonatingly just powerful to see the strength of what the game of golf can do in different countries of Around the World to Change the economy of things to change the hospitality to change tourism all these little ingredients that actually golf is the benefactor of but golf was the initial reason why you could change these deals so I am so proud to be in this role Piers I really am because my whole life somebody asked me a question the other day Greg do you think this is going to affect your legacy and I said you know what maybe my legacy on the golf course is not my legacy maybe my True Legacy is what we're doing with live for the game of golf and giving this opportunity to Collegiate players to eventually to women to the guys we have today to be a true competitor to show that you are additive to the system and our product is speaking for itself is it true you offer Tiger Woods a billion dollars and he turned it down mm-hmm no that's no no there were discussion this was preemie there were discussions with him but we don't get into any discussion about any of the players contracts and final question Greg I'm going to be playing the the Saint Andrews old course and King Barnes and Carnoustie in the Alfred Dunhill links you've obviously you know been very successful on these courses in particular I had a bit of a meltdown on the 17th the famous Road Hole of the old course last year live on Sky uh where I hit I think room 416 with my t-shirt can you just give me a little bit of advice with your old player hat on the how I should play the Road Hole huh well next time you hit room 416 try and put it through that window and go exit the other window that tells me you're hitting the golf ball hard and long so but now listen I'm with you pierce I love St Andrews it's one of my favorite golf courses in the world if the road holders has really hit every player has ever played no matter your best in the world or you're not um and it's just you you're you're lucky you're lucky to be involved with Johann Rupert he's a he's a staunch supporter of the game of golfer what he does there in Scotland year in year out so go enjoy yourself that's all you can do have fun and and hopefully one day I'll be able to play Saint Andrews with you I would love that and I hope this all gets reconciled and I hope golf gets together because I think actually you can all bring something to the party and I do think the debate is laced with hypocrisy and I've said that publicly and I I believe it and it's not to say that I agree with everything thank you for that but I but I do think there's a lot of hypocrisy about the argument and uh I hope the golf is in the end the winner and that everyone comes together and we can all enjoy all the very best players taking each other on again Greg Norman thank you very much thank you very much peers,"The transcript features an interview with Greg Norman, the figurehead of the Saudi-backed LIV Golf Tour, which has stirred controversy within the golf world. Piers Morgan conducts the interview, raising issues such as the tour's impact on the traditional golfing world, criticisms of sportswashing, and the ethical implications of being funded by the Saudi government. Norman defends the LIV Golf Tour as a positive innovation that offers golfers more financial opportunities and freedom as independent contractors. He dismisses criticism as competition-driven animosity and calls out the perceived hypocrisy of the PGA Tour and critics who ignore other Saudi investments in sports like Formula One and football. Norman emphasizes the moral and economic potential of golf as a ""force for good,"" capable of creating opportunities and fostering development worldwide. Despite acknowledging human rights concerns like the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, he reframes the tour’s motives as commercially and developmentally beneficial rather than politically driven. Norman expresses disappointment at being ostracized by established golfing bodies like the PGA and the Royal and Ancient Golf Club and mentions losing personal friends over the divide. He likens the situation to prior disruptions in sports, such as Kerry Packer's influence on cricket, and suggests a future reconciliation where both the LIV and PGA tours can coexist. The interview closes with hopes for the sport's unification and recognition of the benefits LIV brings.",Sportswashing,-1,No,LIV Golf,Saudi Arabia

IT IS CLEAR THE SAUDI'S ARE  LOOKING FOR PEOPLE TO CONSIDER  THEM LIKE THEY DO DUBAI.  AND INTERNATIONAL TRANSIT POINT  AND A PLAYGROUND FOR THE  WEALTHY WHO CAN AFFORD TO  VACATION THERE.

THEY WILL FIGHT THEM ANYWAY.  AND ENABLES THE PJ TO HAVE THE  DEEP POCKETS OF THE LIV GOLF  ORGANIZATION.  IT ENABLES LIV GOLF TO GET  ACCEPTANCE AND SPONSORSHIP AND  VIEWERSHIP THEY NEED.  I WENT TO THE FIRST LIV GOLF  COMPETITION HERE IN THE UK.  IT IS NOT A PGA EVENT AT ALL.  THAT IS VERY COMMERCIALIZED AND  THERE ARE BIG SCREENS AND  úMUSIC.  NOT THE KIND OF THING YOU WOULD  SEE AT THE MASTERS.  THERE OUGHT TO BE A COMING  TOGETHER OF THE CULTURES AND  HOW IT WORKS OUT GOING FORWARD.  TO HAVE A DIFFERENT LOOK ABOUT  THEM IN THE PGA TOURNAMENT.,  THE WORKOUT SCHEDULES.  MATCHES SCHEDULES WITHIN PJ AND  LIV GOLF, BUT WITHIN THE  EUROPEAN TOUR ITSELF THERE ARE  ONLY SO MANY GOOD PLAYERS TO GO  AROUND.  IF YOU CANNOT BEAT THEM,  JOINING THEM.  IN A PERFECT WORLD IT WORKS OUT  FOR BOTH OF THEM.  PUTTING ASIDE WHAT HUMAN RIGHTS  ORGANIZATIONS WOULD SAY.

EVERYBODY IS WAS BE QUIET.  >> AND COVERED UP.  YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK LIKE THE  DALLAS","The transcript revolves around the merger between PGA and LIV Golf, generating nationwide controversy in the U.S. and internationally. It highlights the concerns expressed by lawmakers, human rights activists, and groups connected to the 9/11 attacks, focusing on the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund's role in sportswashing—using sports to distract from the Saudi government's human rights record. The conversation expands on the term ""sportswashing,"" explaining how countries like Saudi Arabia use international sports to improve their image. It references Saudi investments in soccer, including Newcastle United and attempts to lure world-famous players like Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. There's extensive concern over the ethical implications of such investments and whether they help launder the negative image of the Saudi regime. The merger is seen as controversial because it involves prestige within American and international golf communities divided over their stance on LIV Golf. The implications for PGA, considering the deep-pocketed backing of LIV Golf and potential benefits in sponsorships and global outreach, are weighed against serious human rights concerns. The discussion also touches on Saudi Arabia and Qatar's ambitions to become like Dubai, a major international hub. Questions remain over what the merger means for future pressures on Saudi Arabia. The implications for the sport’s ethical concerns and human rights issues will likely persist despite the financial benefits this merger could signify.",Sportswashing,-1,No,LIV Golf,Saudi Arabia

t9IK5MDb9zk,Who Owns Manchester City? Meet Sheikh Mansour,"If Roman Abramovich's 2003 purchase of Chelsea
FC introduced English football to a new generation of billionaires, the 2008 purchase
of Manchester City by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al
Nahyan introduced the game to its first family of trillionaires. The purchase by Mansour's Abu Dhabi United
Group, from previous owner Thaksin Shinawatra, was – to be charitable – something of
a circus. Thaksin, who had just had his assets frozen
after being removed from power in Thailand by a
military coup, was desperate to sell. And there was one
man willing to buy and quickly. Although there was initially some confusion
as to who that was. The face of the deal was Sulaiman
al Fahim, a brash, young Emirati real estate developer who played the Donald Trump character
on a local version of The Apprentice. His catch phrase wasn't “you're fired”
but “impress me”. Many assumed he was the new owner and
few were, indeed, very impressed. He boasted that City would sign the best players
in the world, including Cristiano Ronaldo and said:
“I always feel like I'm a kind of bulldozer, a fully insured bulldozer. If nobody likes it, it starts
moving – even if there are cars in its way, it has to crush the cars and move. I can't stop. If I have an
idea, I have to do it."" It was quickly made clear he was merely a
broker for the deal, and was removed shortly after the
purchase. He was replaced by the bookish Emirati Khaldoon
al Mubarak, who is, today, the chairman. Al Fahim would later emerge as one of a slew
of new owners at Portsmouth that would eventually bring the club close to extinction. His 42 day long tenure of Pompey was described
by the Guardian as “not only the shortest but surely the
most ill-fated tenure in Premier League history.” But at Manchester City in 2008 an orgy of
transfer spending had begun. Within hours of completing
the take over Brazilian international Robinho was signed for £32 million, hours before
the transfer deadline was to shut. More was, of course, to follow. Well over £1 billion was spent on transfers
before this summer's transfer window. In 2011, and with
UEFA beginning to implement its Financial Fair Play rules – instigated in part because
of the spend happy regimes of Abramovich and Sheikh Mansour
– City made the largest single season loss in
the history of English football, £197 million But little was known about Sheikh Mansour,
other than he was a senior royal from the United Arab
Emirates. He has never given an interview in the UK
and has only attended one Manchester City home game in 9 years. Even less was known about his motives. In the statement he released when
buying the club he said: “In cold business terms, Premiership football is one of the
best entertainment products in the world and we
see this as a sound business investment."" But that made little sense given the relatively
small figures involved in the football business. After
all, according to the FT, he made a £1.46 billion profit – through the International
Petroleum Investment Company – in a matter of months
after investing £2 billion to help bail out Barclays
Bank during the 2008 financial crisis. What we do know is that Sheikh Mansour bin
Zayed al Nahyan is one of the most powerful and
influential figures of the ruling Abu Dhabi royal family, if not the whole Middle East. Abu Dhabi is
the largest and richest emirate of the United Arab Emirates, a federation of seven royal
families which was formed in 1971 by Mansour's father
Sheikh Zayed. Abu Dhabi holds most of the oil, and
therefore most of the power. According to OPEC, the UAE oil reserve stands
at close to a billion barrels. Well over 90 per cent is found in Abu Dhabi. Mansour is one of the “Bani Fatima”, the
six sons that Sheikh Zayed fathered with his favourite
wife. The six hold an elevated position in Emirati
society. His brother is Sheikh Mohamed bin
Zayed, the UAE crown prince who controls the military and the internal security apparatus. Little is known of his early life, but a 2006
US State department cable, released by Wikileaks, gave
some biographical information when he came on to their radar after being promoted to
the UAE cabinet. “ He is Deputy Chairman of the Sheikh Zayed
Charitable Foundation, and Chairman of the International Petroleum Investment Corporation. Mansour was an English student at Santa Barbara
Community College in 1989. He speaks English well, but his academic record
was poor.” He was appointed to key positions of state
in his early 30s. In 2004 he was appointed Minister of
Presidential Affairs of the United Arab Emirates, an important position that, as the US intelligence
community noted at the time, effectively made him the “gatekeeper” to the then ailing
President Sheikh Zayed. In 2009 he was appointed a deputy prime minister
of the United Arab Emirates. He also held strategically important roles
in the business world, and was appointed chairman of the
IPPC, one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the UAE. Back then, the UAE presented itself as an
open minded, liberal, reformist presence in a troubled
region; a safe place to do business and holiday. But the truth was and is very different. The UAE has virtually zero democracy, repressive
freedom of speech laws and uses the kafala system
of sponsorship for its migrant population. 90% of the UAE's population are migrants,
the vast majority poorly paid construction workers,
drivers and maids for India, Pakistan and Bangladesh who are paid a pittance and live
in miserable conditions. Whilst Qatar and the 2022 World Cup has drawn
a lone overdue focus on the treatment of migrant workers in the Middle East, few realise that
for many activists and human rights organisations the
problem is bigger, and worse, in the UAE. “Workers are effectively working in conditions
of forced labour,” Human Rights Watch wrote in an
early report on the treatment of migrant workers. Today, Sheikh Mansour's initial purchase has
morphed into something bigger. City Football Club
now owns or holds significant stakes in clubs across the world: New York City FC, Melbourne
City FC, Club Atletico Torque in Uruguay, 20% of
Yokohama F Marinos in Japan and just under half of
Spanish side Girona, which they own alongside Pep Guardiola's brother. Mansour also owns Al
Jazira in the UAE, although this isn't part of CFG. In 2015, CFG sold a 13 per cent stake to China
Media Capital. A few months earlier, Chinese
Premier Xi Jingping had visited Manchester City's training complex and had a selfie taken
with Sergio Aguero and then prime minister David
Cameron. For the likes of Human Rights Watch, the purchase
of Manchester City as well as CFG's stable of ​
clubs, is little more than “reputation laundering.” “ Buying a club buys you cheap advertising
space to promote your brands ‒ from airlines, to
tourism, to construction companies ‒ it also buys you leverage with the press, who
need access to your players and your stadium, and it allows
you to talk breezily about Abu Dhabi values and draw
people ’s attention away from the fact that your record on human rights is grim and worsening,”
said Human Rights Watch's Nicholas McGeehan. It is true that hundreds of millions of pounds
have have been spent on the club's academy and
rebuilding parts of East Manchester. And some changes have been made to UAE law
on the issue of migrant workers – even though few have seen
any meaningful change on the ground. But the question remains: can the actions
of a state really be separated from one of the politicians
responsible for them, even if they are a billionaire who brings glory to your club? For Iyad el Baghdadi, an entrepreneur and
activist who was born and raised in, and later deported
from, the UAE for translating videos relating to the Arab Spring, it is impossible to separate
the two. “ The majority of these figures could not
have become independently rich if it wasn’t for them being
royals in an oil-rich absolute monarchy ... So no, the wealth of the ruling family definitely
cannot be described as “private” wealth.” The results on the pitch and around the Etihad
stadium in Manchester have been stunning. Since
Sheikh Mansour's takeover Manchester City have won two Premier League titles and are
now regulars in the UEFA Champions League. Reputation laundering, profit, ego; whatever
the real reason for Sheikh Mansour to purchase Manchester City there's no denying that he
has transformed the club into one of the world's biggest. But at what cost?","The transcript discusses the 2008 acquisition of Manchester City by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan, marking the entry of wealth from Abu Dhabi into English football. This takeover, likened to a spectacle, involved significant confusion and rapid purchases, including signing Robinho for £32 million. Over £1 billion was invested in transfers by 2011. Despite UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations, designed partly due to such expenditures, Manchester City still posted historic losses. Little is known about Sheikh Mansour, aside from his ties to Abu Dhabi's ruling elite and key economic roles. While he portrays the club purchase as a sound business investment, it seems counterintuitive given his vast wealth elsewhere. The UAE's broader national image contrasts with its severe human rights violations, notably using the kafala system for migrant workers. The transcript suggests that Manchester City's acquisition serves as ""reputation laundering"" for Abu Dhabi, diverting attention from these concerns. Under Sheikh Mansour, Manchester City and related enterprises evolved into a global presence, involving several international clubs. Human rights organizations argue that owning such sports entities is a strategic move to improve Abu Dhabi’s image, with scant improvements in workers' conditions on the ground. The transcript also notes that Sheikh Mansour's financial might stems from his familial and political status rather than individual merit. Despite Manchester City's on-field success, questions loom about the ethical implications of such ownership and its intersection with state and human rights issues.",Sportswashing,-1,No,Manchester City ownership,UAE
mWJXuDTaeX4,How Manchester City became the Disney of Football,"Manchester, globally, used to be viewed as the home of Manchester United with Manchester City   being very much secondary in the minds of football fans outside England. United considered the neighbours   as utterly inferior. Sir Alex Ferguson cited United's rivals as Liverpool, Arsenal, and Leeds.   In that order. That speaks volumes of how far Man City were behind the elite of English football. Fast forward to today and Man City is at the top. Not only of English but European football.  Many would simply attribute their recent success to the heavy investment from Abu Dhabi.   But it wasn't as simple as spending truckloads of money and achieving success overnight.  Similar tries failed. Malaga got a heavy Qatari investment in 2010. Eight years later they were relegated from la Liga.  With Manchester City, there was to be no such misfortune. In fact, it was the rise   of the City Football Group behind the scenes that was the key driver of a decade-long,  billion-pound revolution at the club changing the footballing landscape forever.   Welcome to athletic interest - this is the story of how manchester city became the first truly global football organization.  For a long time, City was a club stumbling between divisions with a series of relegations and promotions. The league finish then progressively 
improved as they consistently ended up between   mid-table and the lower end of the Premier League table. Until the 1st of September 2008 a date that   would forever change the course of history for Manchester City.  They were taken over by the Abu Dhabi United Group transforming the mid-table Premier League Club  into a dynasty in the making. On the day that the group completed the takeover City signed Robinho for a then club-record fee of   over 30 million pounds - immediately highlighting the intention of the new owners. They went on to   spend another 270 million Pounds on players such as Vincent Company, Pablo Zabaleta, Emmanuel Adebayor, Mario Balotelli and Carlo Tevez. However the first success didn't come before they   brought in a new manager Roberto Mancini. With him, the club signed more high-profile players, qualified for the Champions League for the first time, and won the FA Cup. The first major trophy in 35 years. But they weren't done. The group continued to invest. Manchini signed Sergio Aguero for 38 million Pounds among others in 2012. City won their 
final six matches of the season and secured their   first title in 44 years. In the following years, City continued their rise winning more Premier League Titles,  FA and League cups. Now this may all 
seem like it was down to almost 2 billion pounds of investment. And yes - the investment from Abu 
Dhabi indeed played a huge part. However, there is   more to it than what initially meets the eye. The success that City have had over the last decade   would likely not have occurred if it was not for the rise of a company in the background.  The City Football Group took the club to 
new heights - not only because they spend tons of money but because they pioneered a strategy 
never seen before in the World of Football. There are three key players in the success of manchester city. The two that dominate the headlines are Sheikh Mansour in Zayed al-Nayan, 
a member of the royal family of Abu Dhabi   and Khaldoon al-Mubarak - a youthful executive and advisor to the royal family.  Very much simplified - those two bring the money.  But money doesn't bring success if you don't know how to spend it.  You need a strategy! Enter the third player: Ferran Soriano. As former vice president and finance   director of Barcelona, Soriano had bold plans to build the first truly global football organization. He attempted to do something that other clubs like his former employer had never wanted to do.   Set up franchise clubs in other countries. He highlighted the role and potential of franchising   in football along with the contribution 
that merchandise could make to club revenues. His idea was to create a corporation that would have a mixture of a global brand   such as manchester city and many local brands developing talent through a network of clubs   that would provide a pipeline of players for City. More importantly, he foresaw the convergence   of Entertainment and Sport in a globalized world. Soriano observed the potential of   the link between the growth of a big club's worldwide fan bases and their transformation   to global Entertainment companies instead of simply being promoters of local events. To realize this long-term vision, the City Football Group was created in 2013. A corporation that   included a conglomerate of clubs from all over the world. CFG already owns or co-owns 10 clubs on five continents  including the contracts of hundreds of 
professional players as well as carefully picked talents. In 2014 they spend 150 million pounds 
to build a new first-team training and youth   development facility known as the City Football Academy. CFG will scout the globe for players   refining and shaping them in such state-of-the-art academies across several continents selling them on or sending the best to the clubs it will own. An example would be this: Using the network of clubs players may progress from Club Atletico Torque to Girona FC to Manchester City before ending   their careers in India at Mumbai City, China at Sichuan Jiuniu, or the US at New York City.   Through this integrated network, players will be more comfortable with the style of other CFG clubs, those clubs will have insider information on the players while transfer income will end up back   in a single corporate pot. This draws similarities with the Red Bull franchise consisting of Salzburg   New York, Leipzig and Bragantino. Multi-team Ownership groups have become a rising force   changing the future of football. In that sense, CFG was a groundbreaking venture. Buying clubs   and developing players in different continents, sharing scouting and medical data across borders   but also enticing the involvement of sponsors and spreading the City name across the globe. So besides the on-pitch benefits the club network provides CFG with the ability to further develop   the commercial presence and fan engagement. CFG has continued its expansion into new digital technologies. For instance, the development of 
its Citizens Membership Platform and the club's   involvement in the amazon tv series all or nothing becoming the first football club to feature on the hit series. This is just one example of CFG's
influence as a pioneer of content evolution   Manchester City have also launched its own over-the-top streaming subscription service,   partnered with Intel to trial the company's Trueview immersive viewing technology   and most recently became the first team to create their own channel on youtube kids. CFG has also invested in Sapphire Sport. A venture capital fund. Focused on technology and  digital sports the fund plans to make between five and six startup investments each year. This way CFG benefits by exploring E-Sports, Digital Health and Next Generation Media - all fitting   seamlessly into Soriano's vision of CFG as the hub of entertainment and sport. The rise of CFG has   been monumental. But it hasn't been without fails. The Australian league introduced new rules after   CFG circumvented the league's ban on transfer fees between clubs. City bought a local player   outbidding Australian clubs by paying a transfer fee before loaning him straight to melbourne. The league responded by banning the practice for the first year after signing. City had a two-year ban   from the Champions League for serious breach of uefa's financial fair play rules - which never   happened because it was overturned by the court of arbitration for sport. However, the club was   nonetheless fined 9 million pounds for failing to cooperate with the investigations by UEFA.   With the growth of CFG comes scrutiny to the major shareholders in Abu Dhabi.  The allegations of human rights violations of migrant construction workers in the country   along with the region's attitude to LGBT and women's rights have already impacted the company.  They were planning to build a New York City FC stadium on parkland in Queens   but public opposition prevented them 
from doing so due to these concerns. There have been clubs completely transformed by financially powerful owners before sheikh   Mansour's arrival. But none like Manchester City. The last decade represents a story of success,   growth and remarkable off-field development. The City Football Group now boasts a valuation of 4.8 billion Dollars. Sheikh Mansour and the Abu Dhabi 
United Group have invested heavily in Manchester City but the success of the club globally 
cannot be placed solely on their investment. CFG is a paradigm of a 21st-century football business combining the various sectors of money, entertainment, and technology. As Soriano himself stated: At CFG football is often the means to an end not just an end itself. Both sides agreed that City should aspire to being the world's top club. A position long held by either 
Real Madrid, Barcelona or Manchester United.  With the backing of Mansour and Mubarak, Soriano is now upending football's   established order by building its first true multinational corporation. The Disney of football   that other clubs might look to emulate for decades to come.   We don't have any sheik that supports us  we are proud to have patrons!

This investment drastically changed Manchester City's fortune, turning them into one of the most valuable football teams in the world. The transformation was supported by significant financial contributions that led to widespread questions about the intentions behind such investments, which the transcript suggests were driven by the UAE's Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Zayed, to improve the country's international image through sportswashing. The transcript also highlights how Manchester City's management allegedly circumvented UEFA's Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations by funneling funds through sponsorship deals with Abu Dhabi-based companies. This led to several investigations by UEFA, revealing millions in overspending and disguised funding, notably involving club sponsors like Etihad Airways. Despite the accusations and UEFA sanctions, including a two-year ban, the ban was later lifted by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Further investigations by Der Spiegel and the Premier League revealed additional violations, such as pressuring underage players and covert payments to a former coach. The transcript concludes by noting the broader geopolitical objectives of the UAE in Manchester, including infrastructure projects and the establishment of a soft power base. Ultimately, Manchester City's success under Abu Dhabi's ownership is portrayed not only as a sports achievement but also as a demonstration of strategic influence and soft power, overshadowed by the country's human rights issues.",Sportswashing,-1,No,Manchester City ownership,UAE
Z0HWQatIXK8,Explained: Did Manchester City break Premier League rules? - BBC News,Manchester City are Premier League champions but questions remain about how the club does business people don't know if this team this whole project is based on some wrongdoing in the past that's because City Stand Accused of over a hundred breaches of the Premier League's Financial rules some of those charges are extremely serious I mean that there are you know the claim is that they've been basically been falsifying their accounts City denied doing this and the questions they face stretch back years because this is a club transformed from one that went decades without a trophy to one that's won the league five years out of the last six that is a long way from where it was in 2008. financially we were almost out of business but it was about to become the richest club in the world shake mansource a billionaire member of the Abu Dhabi royal family his investment company bought Manchester City and the spending began three years on UEFA the governing body of football in Europe introduced something called Financial fair play it was designed to stop clubs spending more than they earn and to some observers it was clear why I think ffp was brought in principally to reduce the over-reliance on very wealthy benefactors because that's simply not financially sustainable UEFA said it wants to protect clubs from financial trouble and to keep football fair and in 2014 it fined nine clubs for breaking the rules Manchester city was one of them it paid a 60 million euro fine while insisting it hadn't broken the rules that was 2014 four years later the German newspaper Dash Spiegel published this investigation based on leaked emails from inside Manchester City it claimed the club's Newfound Glory is rooted in lies and the story connected to a central Claim about cities finances we've seen this repeated accusation of overly inflated sponsorship deals in other words the delegation is that City agreed deals with sponsors with a connection to Abu Dhabi the sponsors then paid more than the market value that allowed the club to inflate its income which in turn allowed the club to spend more money while appearing to be within the rules of financial fair play Manchester City denies doing this but UEFA investigated and in 2020 it concluded Manchester City committed serious breaches of the UEFA Financial fair play regulations by overstating its sponsorship Revenue it banned City from European Club competitions for two years but the club's position remained unequivocal the most important thing I have to say today is that the allegations are not true and City took the matter to Cass the court of arbitration for sports and contested all of the charges including the sponsorship allegation when the case went before Cass the verdict was that they couldn't find any compelling evidence to say that that was the case and that's why cities Champions League ban was lifted city were back in Europe but that wasn't all the ruling said city did fail to cooperate with UEFA authorities and that most of the alleged breaches were either not established or time-barred in other words some alleged breaches weren't considered on a technicality they've been brought too late one academic describes that in these terms in my personal view what things happened is we've been able to exploit a few legal loopholes here so that Manchester City have never really had to answer the charges that were brought to them and cities Rivals were unimpressed by the outcome Liverpool's Jurgen klopp called it bad for football Jose Mourinho then at Spurs called it disgraceful City though called it a validation of their evidence and in 2021 they reached the final of the Champions League they also won the Premier League that year and the next and then a city chased the League this season in February there was another development the dominant force in the English game hit with an unprecedented catalog of charges by the Premier League that it in its most severe case could see it expelled from the league the period in question is 2009-2018 the first nine full seasons under cities Abu Dhabi ownership the charges included the failure to report Financial results in particular with respect to its Revenue including sponsorship Revenue it's also accused of not giving full details of players salaries and failing to cooperate with the League's investigation if the charges are upheld losing a title is one possible punishment but there are others the most likely sanction will either be a financial one or a points deduction we're not at this stage though City said it was surprised by the charges and denies them the statement pointed to a comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence that exists in support of its position and the BBC's Dan Rowan our City's manager Pep Guardiola about this how confident are you that you have been told everything has it in any way affected your belief in the club my first thought is that we had already been condemned so like it's happened what's happened right now these weeks after Monday it's happened the same will happen in UEFA the club proved that we're completely innocent I said to them what happened so Pap we did nothing wrong but this case won't be quick days before city won the title The Times reported that Manchester City have launched a legal fight against the Premier League charges they're questioning the legality of the process it could be years before what city did and didn't do is settled people are going to continue to raise their eyebrows about until the Premier League either we can prove some you know some kind of um Financial misconduct or sitting in clear the name and so as cities fans celebrate another title and their team's domination of English football the club that's just won the Premier League remains Accused by the Premier League of extensively breaking its rules and gaining a financial advantage,"The transcript discusses Manchester City's achievements and the controversies surrounding its business conduct. Despite being Premier League champions and a dominant force in English football, questions persist about alleged financial misconducts. Manchester City is accused of over a hundred breaches of Premier League financial rules, including falsifying accounts and inflating sponsorship income linked to its ownership by Sheikh Mansour, a billionaire from the Abu Dhabi royal family. The transcript outlines how UEFA imposed a fine in 2014 for financial breaches, which Manchester City contested. In 2020, UEFA banned the club from European competitions for two years for serious breaches, a decision later overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sports due to insufficient evidence and technicalities such as time-barred allegations. Critics argue that Manchester City exploited legal loopholes to avoid answering charges. The Premier League has now leveled further charges, covering the period from 2009 to 2018, including not reporting financial results and not fully cooperating with investigations. Potential penalties could range from financial fines to points deductions. The club denies the charges, emphasizing they have irrefutable evidence supporting their position. However, the case's resolution may take years, and in the meantime, there remain significant questions about the financial operations of the club under its current ownership.",Financial Ethics in Sports,-1,No,Manchester City ownership,UAE
-ugz3j9I-80,How Manchester City Became The Biggest Club in England,Manchester City the club currently on the top of English football one of the two biggest clubs in the world that call Manchester their home there is no doubt Manchester city is currently one of the biggest clubs in the world but how did they even get here how did the club that was languishing in the third division in not so distant past conquer England well we take a look at the transformation of this historic Club in England conquering Behemoth here is the story of the rise of Manchester City [Music] thank you before we delve into how Manchester City got to where they are it is important we delve into the history of this club now unlike what people online would say Manchester City does have a lot of history and not all of it is a failure the club was officially found in 1894 though its origin can be traced back to 1880 when it was founded as Saint Mark's West Gorton which became ardwick association football club in 1887 before it finally became Manchester City in 1894. now we would love to make a video detailing the history of Manchester City so let us know in the comments if you'd like one but it is important to note that Manchester City at one point was the bigger Club in Manchester they were also the first of the two big Manchester clubs to win the FA Cup when they beat Bolton Wanderers one nil in the final in 1904. they won their first ever first division league title in 1937 the same season Manchester United were relegated in fact the 1930s offered a stark contrast in the fortune of the two Manchester clubs as while Manchester City were making cop runs Manchester United where the brink of bankruptcy only saved by James W Gibson but it's a story for another time Manchester City also shared their home stadium main road where they moved in 1923 with Manchester United during the second world war As Old Trafford was damaged during the war while we're skipping large parts of man City's history at the moment any mention of City's history Priya Abu Dhabi era is incomplete without mentioning their most successful era during this time the late 1960s early 1970s 1967-68 season saw Manchester City win their second ever first division League title when they beat Newcastle United on the last day of the Season 4-3 beating Manchester United to the title more success followed when they won the FA Cup in 1969. it all became even sweeter when Manchester City won the first ever European Cup winning the European Cup winners Cup in 1970. the same season they also won The League Cup becoming only the second team in the English History to do a European and a domestic cup double players like Mike summerby and Colin Bill were largely responsible for such performances however 1970s also saw the beginning of the decline of the club from the manager Merry-Go-Round to the boardroom instability they've soon found themselves become a relegation fodder yo-yoing between the first and second division though The Darkest Day in the club's history must have been their relegation to the third division which was called second division digit premier league and English football pyramid they became only the second ever Club to be a European Trophy winner who got relegated to the third division they bounced right back up by winning a dramatic playoff against Gillingham that saw Paul takeoff score an equalizer in the dying moments to help City bounce back from two goals down and eventually win on penalties back-to-back promotion soft City come back to Premier League though they were relegated again in 2001. Kevin Keegan took over as the manager and won an immediate promotion back to the Premier League by winning the first division title 2003 four close season also saw Manchester City move from their much beloved home main road to the city of Manchester Stadium city were now firmly established as a Premier League mid-table club finishing between 16th and eighth position since moving to the new stadium however things were about to change soon in 2007 the club found a silver lining former Thai prime minister saksin chinawatra acquired a 75 stake in the club for 81.6 million pounds and installed former England manager swen Goran Erickson as manager his reputation was at best sketchy as he was embroiled in a Litany of corruption charges back home nevertheless there was hope that the Takeover will help Manchester City climb back up the Premier League ladder players worth around 60 million pounds were brought in and Manchester City started playing some attractive football money was spent on the likes of elano Valerie boshinov and vedran called Luca the season started brightly and early in the season Manchester City won the Manchester Derby winning at home against United 1-0 City kept a pace for most of the early and mid-season part as they hovered around fifth position however the early momentum of the Season soon dissipated and City slipped all the way to ninth by the end which ended with a humiliating 8-1 defeat away at Middlesbrough city did manage to qualify for the UEFA cup based on the UEFA Fair Play points but it wasn't enough to save Ericsson's job Ericsson was then summarily sagged with Mark Hughes taking over with his assets Frozen and sitting in a financial turmoil Shinawatra was looking to sell the club enter Shake Mansour CE here we go for years Manchester city was everybody's favorite second club and everyone's favorite joke Manchester United even had a ticker counting how many years Manchester City had gone without winning any trophies despite brief spells of success Manchester City largely was a club that took a step forward only to go several steps back sakshinawatra's takeover brought promise but it also dissipated and the club was in financial turmoil amidst all the noise came the sight of a silver lining Sheikh man so bin Zaid al-nahyan a member of the UAE royal family had arrived with his Abu Dhabi United group or audg to take over the club their arrival wasn't unprecedented as just five years ago another club in Chelsea was bought by the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich and his Deep Pockets helped Chelsea establish themselves amongst the bigwigs of the Premier League namely Manchester United Arsenal and Liverpool Manchester City had a distinct advantage of being situated in a big city had a loyal support and a big Stadium according to Suleiman al-fahim who represented Sheikh Mansoor at the time they saw Manchester City as a top four club and wanted to make it one of the biggest in England soon Manchester City's Fortune was going to turn within hours of acquisition the city ownership decided to Splash the cash signing rubinio for a then record fee of 32.5 million pound from Real Madrid they also launched unsuccessful bids like the 30 million pound for Tottenham hotspur's Dimitar barbatov who decided to go to the red side of the Manchester according to reports City also bid for the 30 million pound rated David via of Valencia and Mario Gomez of Stuttgart in fact Sky Sports reported City could have bid for as many as six top Superstars that day Manchester city's new owners had come with a Clear Vision they wanted to make Manchester City the top club in the land despite the failure of Landing all the transfer targets City still made a huge Splash with incoming players like Joe Vincent company Pablo zabaleta Sean Wright Phillips Craig Bellamy nigil de Jong Shea given Etc were over 100 100 million pounds however it didn't bring instant success under Mark Hughes Manchester City ended 10th in the league and while they did well to reach the UEFA cup quarterfinals the season proved to be an overall disappointment however this city management wasn't going to stop 2009-10 season yet again saw an influx of a lot of new players to the tune of over 100 million pounds spent again the biggest Acquisitions were Manchester United's Carlos Tevez and Arsenal's Emmanuel Adebayor and KOLO Toure despite a promising start yet again a series of draws mid-season meant Mark Hughes time was up Manchester City appointed Robert tomanchini and he had an immediate impact City ended the season at fifth qualifying for the Europa League playoff round and showed marked improvement in quality of football in Mancini they had signed a quality coach and due to the cash spent in the market the quality of players was quickly improving however the season yet again ended trophilus 2010-11 season proved to be the turning point for Manchester City in many ways as usual City splashed the cash bringing in names like yayatori from Barcelona David Silva from Valencia Mario Balotelli from inter James Milner from Aston Villa Jerome Boateng from Hamburg and Erin jecko from Wolfsburg to a tune of over 140 million pounds under Mancini's continued stewardship cities results in the Premier League improved dramatically as they climbed up to the third position their highest position since the Inception of Premier League this meant they also qualified for the UEFA Champions League for only the second time since 1968-69 season when it was called the European Cup but the biggest achievement for them this season was winning the FA Cup ending the 35 years of trophy tract the tribe was made all the sweeter as City beaded City Rivals Manchester United in the semi-final one nil before beating Stoke City in the finals Carlos teves was instrumental through the campaign as he backed 23 goals in all competitions 20 of them coming in the Premier League earning him the Premier League Golden Boot award that he shared with Dimitar Berbatov of Manchester United Joe Hart won the Golden Glove award keeping 18 clean sheets while company and Terrace made the PFA Team of the Year it was clear that the team was improving at the rate of knots and the trophies that Manchester City's owners craved so much were on their way while 2010-11 was a breakout season for them 2011-12 season was when they truly arrived the splashing of the cash continued as City acquired the services of the likes of gal cliche and Sami nazre from Arsenal and Stefan Savage from partisan with the biggest acquisition for them was the Argentine Striker Sergio Aguero from Atletico Madrid for a reported fee of 36 million pounds Aguero made an immediate impact as he scored a brace on his debut of the bench against Swansea City it up should crack her into the corner Manchester City led the table for most of the season over the arrivals Manchester United that included a 6-1 dropping of United at the Old Trafford however United overtook them on game week 28 and a few draws and losses meant Manchester United had taken the lead however five wins on the Trot brought both Manchester City and United level on points on the final day of the Season city were ahead on goal differential which meant all they had to do was win against QPR to lift the Premier League for the first time in 44 years it is said that money can't buy everything and fairly had become such a part of Manchester City's DNA that winning against a relegation threatened QPR at home was far from given and so it was proving to be as despite an early goal by City QPR took the lead in one of the most dramatic ends to a Premier League season City entered the injury time down one goal to two and while Manchester United wrapped up a one-nil victory at Sunderland something miraculous transpired at the Etihad something that words cannot describe with just the injury time left to play Erin jecko equalized but it wasn't going to be enough and then the Clock Struck 93 20. [Applause] I swear you'll never see anything like this ever again Manchester City had won their first ever premier league title a 44 year wait for a Top Flight league title had come to an end after such a historic season Manchester City entered the 2012-13 season as the defending Premier League champions there was an air of optimism around while some big names like Mario balotellis left some big transfers in meant Manchester City were still looking forward to more silverware they had a settled spine of Aguero two-ray Silva accompany zabalita Etc alongside some really exciting young players like Micah Richards and Jack Rod will however the season didn't turn out as everybody was hoping for a slow start meant Manchester City were lagging behind for most of the season and never recovered to challenge the eventual Champions Manchester United they finished second by 11 points combine it with a complete no-show in Champions League where they failed to win a single game and crashed out completely at the group stage and Roberto Mancini's job was in Jeopardy the final straw however was the FA Cup where despite a great run till the final Manchester City lost to Reagan athletic the same club that got relegated from the Premier League this very season manchini was sacked on May 13 2013 and Manuel Pellegrini was appointed the manager a month later the 2013-14 season under Manuel Pellegrini proved to be a success this season saw Carlos Tevez leave for Juventus but also saw likes of fernandinho joined the club despite a shaky start City recovered spectacularly this was also a season where City ended up scoring over A Century of goals in the Premier League this season is also remembered for the infamous Steven Gerard slip against Chelsea that effectively ended Liverpool's campaign for the Premier League Manchester City ended up winning the Premier League title for the second time they also won The League Cup making it a domestic league in cup double this was also the first season Manchester City made out of their Champions League group however they were defeated by Barcelona in the round of 16 ending with another Champions League disappointment nevertheless with two Premier League titles in the last three seasons it seemed like Manchester City had established themselves as a permanent titled Contender despite all the success they had till now the next two seasons were less than favorable for Manchester City the big money transfers had continued throughout pellegrini's managerial era but very few of them were turning out to be good cities still largely dependent on the spine hide under manchini and before namely Aguero company Silva Toure Joe Hart Etc Fernandina was a good acquisition but defensive frailties remained despite multiple recruitments in defensive positions of the likes of bakari Sanya ilakim mengala and Martin de Michaelis City ended up behind Chelsea by eight points in the 2014-15 Premier League season and yet again went out to Barcelona in the round of 16 of Champions League City also had a horror show in the Cup competitions crashing out of both FA Cup and League Cup in the fourth round the season went trophyless and the situation only got worse the next season 2015-16 Premier League season is famous for Leicester City's miraculous run to the Premier League title but this season was the worst Manchester City performed in the Premier League since the 2010-11 season ending a fourth with just 66 points the lowest in this period City's performances in the Champions League were better they won their group and made it all the way to the semi-finals beating Dynamo cave and Paris Saint-Germain in the process however they lost a narrowly to Real Madrid and it meant Champions League was yet too far of a step for this Manchester City team they however did win a trophy winning League Cup against Liverpool and penalties in the final overall the season was a disappointment and it was clear that Manchester City's lofty Ambitions were a bit too big to be fulfilled by Pellegrini since the Abu Dhabi takeover of Manchester City the new owners had poured almost a billion pounds in transfers brought in some of the best place in their positions had improved the stadium and established a very good Academy and yet they had only won two Premier League titles two League cups and one FA Cup in those eight seasons the success on the pitch wasn't really matching with the investment they had made it was time to get to the next level and they made the move Pep Guardiola is regarded as one of the best coaches in football he had transformed Barcelona winning 14 trophies with them that included three La Liga titles and two Champions Leagues after a season sabbatical he joined Bayern and found more success winning three consecutive Bundesliga titles so when Pep Guardiola was announced as the manager of Manchester City people took notice some didn't think pep guardiola's tactics would work in a physical League like the Premier League some doubted if this Manchester City team had the quality of Pep's previous clubs like Barcelona or Bayern Munich despite all the doubts there was also a case of optimism among the city fans who knew that a team comprising of the likes of Aguero David Silva Toure company Kevin De bruyne had enough quality to succeed Manchester City had been working behind the scenes to make the transition for Pep as smooth as possible Pep's old bosses at Barcelona shake it back at his 10 and faran Soriano had been hired by Manchester City four years prior and were looking to hire Guardiola ever since Guardiola rung out immediate changes and the biggest casualty of his changes was Joe Hart Joe Hart was considered to be one of the best shot Stoppers in the Premier League and had been Manchester City's first choice keeper since 2010. however unimpressed by Hearts skills on the ball Guardiola throws him out of the first team dimming him unfit to play a sweeper keeper role that Guardiola wanted before eventually loaning him out to Torino [Music] Aguero too saw his minutes reduced as Guardiola wanted a striker who was Adept at pressing as well tourist agents comments saw two or two sideline before he finally apologized and was allowed back in the team Manchester City's defense needed bolstering too as Vincent Kompany was spending more and more time in the infirmary so John stones and Nicholas ottomendi were brought in Joe Hart was replaced by Claudio Bravo kundoran Nolito sane and Gabriel Jesus were also signed this season it seemed Guardiola was hard at work to mold City into his vision the changes however didn't work in his first season after a Bright Start cities struggled through the mid-season and fell behind Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspurs for most of the Season eventually ending up third 15 points behind the eventual Champions Chelsea Claudio Brown will proved to be a disaster between the sticks and was dropped in favor of City's backup keeper Willy Caballero Midway through the season cities fullbacks zabalita clichy color of assonia just couldn't keep up with Pacey Wingers defeats away to Leicester by a margin of four goals to two and at Everton by the margin of four nil really showed deficiencies in City's defense and the champions league elimination in the round of 16 at the hands of Monaco which saw City going out on away goals despite scoring five goals at home just solidified City's defense needing an overhaul despite the summer Acquisitions guardiola's first season in the Premier League went trophyless his first ever season and questions were being asked if the tactics can actually work in England [Music] after an unsuccessful first season Guardiola knew he had to make sweeping changes to the team gone were the Aging fullbacks meaning all of Sanya color of clichy and zabaleta were gone also gone with the backup keeper Caballero and last season's acquisition Nolito Kyle Walker Benjamin Mendy and Danilo joined to bolster the defense Claudio Bravo was relegated to the backup keeper role as Edison was brought in Bernardo Silva too joined this season the January transfer window saw imeric Laporte coming over from atletic Bilbao in All City spent a total of over 250 million pounds in this one season their biggest outlay in a single season and the extravagant spending boar fruit immediately City went on an undefeated streak of 22 Premier League games which included 18 consecutive victories the longest streak of all time in the English football Manchester city became the first premier league team to accumulate 100 points in a season winning guardiola's first premier league title usurping A Distant second Manchester United by 19 points city were crowned Champions with five games still remaining in the season such was the dominance not only that City also went on an incredible cup run winning The League Cup beating Arsenal three-nil in the final a league and cup Triumph couldn't be however extended to the Champions League the city went out to Liverpool in the quarterfinals they were knocked out of the FA Cup by their old Nemesis vegan athletic in the fifth round despite these losses it was a highly successful second season for Guardiola ending with the league and domestic cup double 2018-19 season proved to be an even bigger success City's only big acquisition of the season was Riyad maharez from Leicester well a lot of players left the club biggest among them were Yaya Toure and Joe Hart Manchester City had a team that was firing on all cylinders Aguero Sterling de bruona gundoran David Silva Bernardo Silva Leroy sane fernandinho Laporte durson Etc made for a fearsome team and fearsome they proved on the field Manchester City swept all the domestic trophies available during the Premier League League Cup FA Cup and even the curtain razor the fa Community Shield this season also saw the emergence of klopp LED Liverpool who matched City step by step eventually falling short by just one point in the league City and Liverpool accrued 98 and 97 points respectively the highest total for number one and number two teams in the league ever this season also proved to be the last four cities captain for the last decade Vincent Kompany who kept off a glowing career with a league winning goal against Leicester however the Champions League was becoming a bane for Manchester City in one of the most dramatic quarterfinals city were knocked out by the eventual finalists Tottenham Hotspurs on away goals which saw a chaotic second leg played at the Etihad despite the Champions League heartbreak this was City's most successful season ever it seemed city were primed for a three-peat alas it was not to be the 2019-20 Premier League Seasons or Manchester City start slowly City lost their best defender in La Porta early in the season and then never recovered with company having departed and not being replaced and Stones too struggling with Fitness and form City's defense was in shambles but it was not all the beginning of 2020 saw the covid-19 pandemic sweep the world and it had its effect on football too football was suspended for a period of time and when it resumed it didn't feel the same for a long time the season petered out for a city who had to contend with the solitary trophy in the League Cup City ended a distant second behind a rampant Liverpool who won their first Premier League trophy ever and the first first division League trophy in 30 years Manchester City's woeful Champions League luck continued as well as they were knocked out at the quarterfinal stage again this time by Leon after two highly successful season this season proved to be a damn squib and the dream of three-peat never materialized foreign it was apparent that City's defense needed showing up form had left ottomendi who saw his time curtailed while the Porter and stone struggled with Fitness issues ottomendi left for Porto making space for Ruben Diaz Nathan RK was also brought in from a relegated Bournemouth in attack Leroy sana's head was turned by Bayern Munich and a German usually cannot resist that kind of Temptation City tried to replace him with Faron Taurus however City started poorly and after the first nine games city were as low as 13th in the Premier League Table in fact city were languishing at eight as late as game 16 but this city team knows how to go on a run Manchester City went on a 13-game win streak mid-season overcoming everyone above them and went to the top of the table in the 20th game and didn't look back the final table didn't show City's poor start as they comfortably ran with the league ending 12 points clear of Manchester United to win the third league title in Four Seasons City's Fortune turned in the Champions League as well after three consecutive Champions League campaigns where they faltered at the quarterfinal stage they went above and beyond beating the likes of Borussia Dortmund and Paris Saint-Germain in the process to reach their first ever Champions League final alas City faulted yet again in an important Champions League game this time losing to tickles Chelsea one nil Chelsea was a thorn in cordial aside as they also beat City in the FA Cup semi-final by the same score city did manage to win the league cup beating Arsenal Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspurs in the quarterfinals semi-finals and the finals respectively it was a great comeback for a city team after a kovid ravaged season I was looking like finally the owner's goal of transforming Manchester City into a footballing juggernaut was bearing fruits the 2021-22 season saw Manchester City making the most expensive signing of all time in English football to be broken by Chelsea the very next season when they signed Jack grealish from Aston Villa for a reported 100 million pounds Faron Torres left for Barcelona but overall there was minimal changes to the city first team that won the league and reached the Champions League final the last season City started slowly yet again however as we've all become accustomed to City went on a 12-game win streak in the middle of the season to take up the first position in the table This Time Again city were chased by a Relentless Liverpool who kept very close to them since losing the first position on the Champions League front Manchester City went past sporting and Atletico Madrid in a round of 16 and the quarterfinals and then took a lead against Real Madrid in the home leg beating them 4-3 this was the edition of Champions League that saw the away goal rules scraped which meant the away goals didn't matter in the grand scheme of things it seemed City where Andrew a second consecutive Champions League final when they took the lead through mahrez in the second leg at Santiago banabeu around 73rd minute however it proved to be one of the most dramatic semi-final clashes of all time Manchester City who led the Thai 5-3 till the 90th minute conceded twice under a minute [Music] made a couple of really good chances and he's made a goal oh how can you believe it Rodrigo again unbelievable and then conceded another goal through a

we could leave it here but we all know the rise of Manchester city has more to it as a club with as longer history as Manchester City controversies are bound to be part of that like how Manchester City were found to be guilty of breaking the rules of the league during the 1904 or 5 season when it was found that city were making additional payments to their players over the then weekly cap or four pound a week 17 players were fined and suspended until January 1907 while city were forced to sell their players however it is the recent controversies and allegations that cost a question mark or the club's current success since the Abu Dhabi takeover Manchester City have been constantly accused of financial doping in 2014 UEFA sanctioned Manchester City for breaching the newly introduced Financial fair play rules finding them 49 million pounds and restricting their Champions League Squad to just 21 Men instead of the usual 25 men it was later reduced to 16 million pounds however the biggest bombshell in the Abu Dhabi Man City era dropped in 2018 when tsp Eagle ran a report that claimed Manchester City owners had broken many Financial fair play rules that they had falsely disguised Equity money as sponsorships and that some sponsorship deals were inflated due to the relationship to the Abu Dhabi owners themselves like the Etihad or etisalat multiple League emails were published and sparked a worldwide controversy UEFA took notice and began to investigate in February 2020 UEFA banned Manchester City for two years from competing in the Champions League citing serious breaches of ffp rules and fined 30 million euros for failing to cooperate with the investigation city were found to have overstated sponsorship revenue and break even information in accounts submitted to UEFA between 2012 and 2016. City pled not guilty and appealed to the court of arbitration of sports in Switzerland while Cass upheld the punishment for failing to cooperate with the investigation Cass did overturn the ban citing the fact that most of the alleged breaches were either not established or time-bought they also reduced the fine from 30 million euros to 10 million euros Manchester City lawyers call this a huge Victory a city's troubles didn't end here J.S Pagel released more leaked emails citing more financial irregularities and in light of these allegations and UEFA verdict the Premier League started to investigate in February 2023 and another big bombshell Premier League had brought more than 115 charges against Manchester City relating to alleged Financial irregularities between 2019 and 2017-18 and failing to cooperate with investigation since 2018 and have been referred to an independent commission Manchester City have yet again denied any wrongdoing as of now the case is still ongoing and from various reports it seems it could take months or even years before any verdict is reached the Manchester City owners have also been called out regularly due to their country's human rights records and called Manchester City a sports washing project as in it is a vehicle to make the owner's image more palatable despite all the allegations and controversies Manchester City have gone from strength to strength Manchester City's rise can be attributed to many factors while people love pointing to the unprecedented money poured into the club it's also a fact that money alone cannot buy success not without a proper plan we don't have to look any further than Manchester United the local Rivals who have spent almost the same amount of money in the same period and haven't had anywhere near that kind of success in this period Manchester City's long-suffering self-deprecating fans who stuck with the team through the thick and thin have a reason to enjoy their recent success Manchester City have become an English footballing Behemoth and at the time of making of this video I stood at the cusp of History like the video if you liked it share if you find it worthy and subscribe for more such videos this is salty football thank you for watching [Music] [Music] thank you [Music],"The transcript details the evolution of Manchester City Football Club from its early history to its transformation into a successful football club following the acquisition by Sheikh Mansour and the Abu Dhabi United Group. It covers Manchester City's journey, focusing on the significant changes and investments made since 2008. The arrival of prominent manager Pep Guardiola and subsequent financial investments led to considerable success, including multiple Premier League titles and domestic cup wins. However, the journey wasn’t without controversy, particularly regarding financial fair play (FFP) breaches. The transcript also highlights accusations of sportswashing by the club's owners due to the human rights issues in the UAE. Recent notable events include UEFA’s investigation into City’s finances leading to a temporary Champions League ban that was later overturned.

WGyomoSnP-A,A Brief History of the City Football Group,"When the Abu Dhabi United Group purchased
90% of Manchester City’s shareholdings in September 2008 for a princely sum of 210 million pounds it transformed the Blues overnight into the richest football club in the world. The fabulously wealthy investment company
– owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family – had long been keen to expand their interests into English football and, after briefly considering Newcastle
United and Everton, in City they found a club primed for success after years of relegations and underachievement. With limitless funding avai lable a spree
of marquee signings were undertaken as City strove to make a quantum leap from mediocrity into becoming one of Europe’s very elite. Two Premier League titles
and regular appearances in the Champions League within their first ten years suggest they’re
well on their way to achieving that aim. Yet for all the accelerated spending on the
pitch Mansour – a man not known for making public statements – wanted to make clear back in 2008 that this was anything but a short-term project. “We are building a structure for the future,” he insisted. “Not just a team of all-stars.” That structure largely took the form of what
became known as the Etihad Campus, a state of the art
training complex and academy that was soon dubbed in the press a ‘£200m football factory’ while away from the 16 immaculate football pitches
and three gymnasiums an aggressive commercial blueprint ensured that the club is no longer
bankrolled by their owners but instead is self-sufficient. But Sheikh Mansour’s vision didn’t end there. He wanted to do more than just conquer Europe. Four significant events made 2012 a defining year for the Abu Dhabi United Group and Manchester City. In May Roberto Mancini’s side won the club
its first league title for 44 years while that summer
saw the appointment of two former Barcelona bigwigs in CEO Ferran Soriano and Director
of Football Txiki Begiristain
to the club’s hierarchy. City had long coveted
Barcelona’s footballing philosophy and business model and – with the additional signing
of American Tom Glick as their new Chief Commercial Officer
– now had a dream team in place to mirror the Catalonian’s mega success. Less welcome that year was UEFA’s introduction
of their Financial Fair Play Regulations, established to prevent clubs spending more than what they earn. With their expenditure on players now capped
ADUG began to look at alternative means to fulfil their considerable ambitions which
is where MLS Commissioner Don Garber enters stage left
with an intriguing proposition. Would City be interested in forming a start-up
club, based in New York that could directly be affiliated
with the Manchester giants? The idea particularly appealed to Soriano
who had previously been keen for Barcelona to export their global
brand to America in a similar fashion and so – once a
partnership with the New York Yankees had been secured and the $100m expansion fee was paid – in May 2013 New York City FC was officially announced
as the MLS’s 20 th franchise. Free from their European constraints of FFP
superstars were duly bought for the fledgling outfit. David Villa was signed from Atletico Madrid. A year later Andreo Pirlo joined the US gravy-train while Patrick Vieira – previously City’s Elite
Development Squad’s manager – was installed as boss.​ When a third club was acquired in January 2014 – Melbourne Heart from Australia’s A-League for $12m that was swiftly trademarked as Melbourne
City Football Club – it necessitated the formation of the City Football Group, a holding company designed to oversee a network of linked clubs around the globe. Twelve months later another major development
was announced out of the blue when a Chinese consortium called China Media Capital – backed
by the Chinese government – invested £265M into the City Football Group, a 13% stake which valued the company at a staggering three billion pounds. City chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, said of
the deal: “this will leverage the incredible potential that
exists in China”. This year alone the portfolio has expanded
further with the acquisition of a Uruguayan second division club Atletico Torque while a collaboration agreement has been reached with Atletico Venezuela. Soriano insists such a strategy “expands
the options for identifying and developing South American talent.” With a 20% stake in Yokohama F Marinos from
Japan creating a further partnership with car manufacturers Nissan the intention is clearly to have close working relationships in every continent and all with commercial partnerships, sponsorship
opportunities, academy operations – including far-reaching scouting networks - and help
in getting around third party ownership problems with players in mind. The question now – as the City football
group continues to grow and assimilate themselves into foreign leagues – is where next in their quest for world domination?","The transcript discusses the transformative acquisition of Manchester City by the Abu Dhabi United Group in 2008. Under the ownership of Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, Manchester City turned into one of the richest football clubs, making significant investments in player signings and infrastructure. A notable development was the creation of the Etihad Campus, intended to ensure the club's future sustainability. The vision extended beyond European success; in 2012 marked a pivotal year with the addition of key figures from Barcelona and challenges like UEFA's Financial Fair Play Regulations. To counter such challenges, the Abu Dhabi United Group expanded their global footprint, exemplified by establishing the New York City FC in partnership with the MLS and acquiring Melbourne Heart, later rebranded as Melbourne City FC. These expansions necessitated the formation of the City Football Group to manage the growing network of clubs. Investments also included partnerships like the 20% stake in Yokohama F. Marinos and collaborations in South America, furthering the group's reach. The transcript notes substantial financial involvement from a Chinese consortium valuing the City Football Group at £3 billion, illustrating an ambition for global influence. The strategic aim is to establish a comprehensive network for talent identification, development, and commercial partnerships across continents, raising questions about their future global ambitions.",Sportswashing,0,No,Manchester City ownership,UAE
yDjISzW4QDk,Manchester City's Controversial Etihad Deal,the 2007 8 Premier League season could not finish fast enough for Manchester City the final match understand Goran Eriksson was a nine goal thriller at Middlesbrough were unfortunately City conceited eight the club's reputation at the time was that of Keystone Cops of English football a bunch of Mavericks in blue where the wheels were always on the brink of falling off in those days their hated local rivals are Old Trafford looked upon City with mocking contempt rather than as an enemy saving their true loathing for Liverpool and Leeds United behind the scenes things were even worse whilst City fans were excited at the start of the 2007 2008 season at the prospect of new tie owner Texan Shinawatra's promises of big spending and success an investment in the likes of Rolando Bianchi Felipe Caicedo and Alana didn't prove to be successful and the money from the new owner came from unreliable sources city borrowed 46 million pounds in one year if Shinawatra zone ership whilst borrowing money has some benefits these loans came at a price as city's interest costs more than doubled to ten point seven million pounds the acquisition of the club by Sheikh Manso in September 2008 safe City in more ways than one and by this stage Shinawatra had more pressing issues to deal with in the form of corruption charges from his homeland Manso transformed city with an initial scattergun spending policy on marquee signings such as Robinho and an audacious attempt to sign Kaka at this time transfer fees and wages were an irrelevance to the owners this impacted on city's financial performance which moved from a profit of 17 million pounds in 2006 to a loss of 190 million pounds in 2011 these losses were sustainable because Sheikh Mansour was willing to underwrite the losses through a combination of interest-free loans and shares had financial Fair Play rules been in existence at the time than the investment would not have been possible this allowed the Abu Dhabi owners to pump nearly 1.2 billion pounds worth of cash into the club the owners huge investment startled the existing elite of European football who now saw City as a potential threat to their cartel at the top table of UEFA competitions these established clubs put pressure on Platini the UEFA president to introduce some method of reduce the rise of new money clubs such as Chelsea city and PSG after much internal haggling and huge amounts of money being spent on accounting and legal fees by UEFA Financial Fair Play rules relating to non-payment of transfer fees were introduced in 2011-12 and then extended in the 13-14 season in the form of a break-even model these rules are now so complex that the latest version takes up to 116 pages of legal and accounting pontification UEFA claim that FFP can be summarized in one sentence financial fair play is about improving the overall financial health of European club football and we were described that one sentence in one word and that word is nonsense businesses go bankrupt due to a lack of cash not profit which is an arbitrary accounting concept open to sleight of hand estimates and manipulation the initial rules restricted clubs losses 245 million euros over three years ending in that period and then 30 million euros from 2015-16 a break-even model calculates losses as income less expenses clubs have three main sources of income matchday broadcasting and commercial it's difficult but not impossible to manipulate matchday income which is the number of tickets sold multiplied by the ticket price and the same is true for broadcast income which is negotiated and distributed centrally by individual leagues and uf4 itself commercial income is different as it represents deals signed by clubs and their business partners the prices for these deals are open to negotiation in the years prior to the Abu Dhabi takeover city's commercial income was far less than their rivals from Old Trafford whose ability to negotiate deals in the back of their popularity and success was ruthlessly exploited by unites American owners this is where eyebrows had been raised in relation to Manchester City Etihad Airways the national airline of Abu Dhabi the place Thomas Cook as shirt sponsor in 2009 this had an immediate impact on city's commercial revenues which increased by 126 percent in 2011 the Etihad deal was expanded to include naming rights for what had previously been known as the city of Manchester Stadium which became the Etihad Stadium along with surrounding training facilities called the Etihad campus the agreement was for 10 years at an estimated value of 400 million pounds which included shirt sponsorship as well as the name lies at the time the largest fee for naming rights was just 2.8 million pounds per year by Arsenal for the Emirates and other clubs had tried and failed to secure high-value sums from sponsors the accusation leveled at City is that the Etihad deal has been used to reduce the club's losses and help it in satisfying financial Fair Play rules because of the Etihad Deal city's commercial income initially matched that of United but has subsequently fallen behind as their rivals have managed to partner themselves with everyone from Japanese track to partner Yanmar to mattress partner milli city's partnership with Etihad does however mean that they have the second highest amount of commercial income in the Premier League and the 5th largest of any football team globally such was the extent of the Etihad deal that there were accusations of financial doping from the likes of arson Venga UEFA had tried to minimize the impact of deal signed by clubs with organizations connected to the owners through the related party transaction rules a related party is one that is controlled by the club owner or a close relative in addition UEFA have set up a club financial control body to ensure that clubs do not overstate the value of commercial deals city tried to set up their deal with Etihad in such a way that it complied with financial fair play rules but such were their losses they were put on the FFP naughty step in 2014 with the following penalties a forty nine million pound fine part of which was conditional on improving the club's business model City Julie received a rebate of two thirds of this sum an agreement not to increase the wage bill excluding bonuses for two seasons a squad reduction for UEFA competitions from 25 to 21 players and a reduction in the amount spent on player signings limited to a net 49 million pound spend City managed to comply with the sanctions and kept their wage bill which had been 36 million before Shinawatra in 2007 and zoomed to 233 million by 2014 in check until Pep Guardiola arrived PSG were given a similar fine in what was seen as a victory for the existing elite of European clubs clubs can however dispute any rulings for the CF CP and this is likely to trigger a long and expensive legal action where the winners will be the accountants and the lawyers in 2015 under pressure from you guessed it a series of lawsuits from unhappy club UEFA relaxed the ffp rules this has allowed the likes of city and PSG to spend money more freely the city and Etihad partnership was born to an extent out of necessity on the part of the club to satisfy you a firs financial Fairplay rules if the value of the deal initially was excessive given the global position and reputation of city in 2011 then today with the club having won the Premier League three times the four hundred million pound deal which has been renegotiated since its original signing is probably about right for Pep Guardiola's team in the current market,"The transcript reviews the financial history and transformation of Manchester City Football Club. At the end of the 2007-08 Premier League season, the club was struggling under the ownership of Thaksin Shinawatra, whose promises of grandeur were hollow as the club incurred large debts and struggled on the field. Shinawatra faced corruption charges, which complicated his financial input. The landscape shifted radically with the arrival of Sheikh Mansour in September 2008. His substantial financial backing rescued and transformed the club, allowing for high-profile player acquisitions despite sustaining significant financial losses. These losses were managed by Sheikh Mansour's willingness to cover them via interest-free loans and shares.",Financial Ethics in Sports,-1,No,Manchester City ownership,UAE
hbkCDZcMeLA,Sports lawyer discusses the Premier League charges against Manchester City,foreign City have allegedly broken and how many the first is with regards to the accuracy of their reporting of financial information premier league rules require clubs to report in the utmost good faith accurate financial information that gives a true and Fair View of the club's financial position in particular with its respect to its Revenue City allegedly breached those rules 50 times between 2009 and 2018. the next is with regards to manager remuneration clubs are required to include full details of manager remuneration in their relevant contracts with their manager City allegedly breached those rules eight times between 2009 and 2013. the Manchester City manager for that period was Roberto Mancini who led them to their first premier league title the next is regards to player remuneration clubs are required to include full details of player remuneration in their relevant contracts with their player City allegedly breached those rules 12 times between 2010 and 2016. premier league rules also require clubs to comply with the uefa's regulations including uefa's Club licensing and financial fair play regulations City allegedly breached those rules five times between 2013 and 2018 City also breached premier league rules around profitability and sustainability it is alleged 25 times between 2015 and 2018. and the final breaches relate to the Premier League's investigation in Two Cities finances since 2018. the league requires at requires clubs to cooperate and assist with investigations including by providing documents and information in the utmost good faith City allegedly breached those rules 30 times so here's what the ramifications could be for City an independent commission will review the alleged breaches and they then have the power to do the following suspender Club from playing league matches deduct points recommend that league matches be replayed recommend the league expels the respondent club order compensation Council or refuse registration of players conditional punishment order Club to pay costs or make other orders as they see fit so that's the situation as it stands at this moment let's um dig a little deeper into this delighted to say we can speak to the sports lawyer Stephen Taylor Heath from jmw solicitors thank you very much for joining to us uh joining us can you explain just how severe these charges are against Manchester City well I think cave and uh your piece there really um in the short space of time I'm very well summarizes the the current situation the extent of the uh charges that are being brought both in terms of volume and the period over which it relates um the the the the interesting thing as well particularly is that the allegations in relation to this statements the accounts um seems to be from 2009 to 2017 but now we're in 2023 and the charges in relation to the six years after that relate to the disclosure of information and cooperation with the Premier League and now we're at the point where they're effectively convening an independent commission to uh for that independent commission to actually look into these charges yeah okay um is this unprecedented City face over 100 charges has any club ever been accused of this amount of alleged breach breaches and if so what was the outcome then well no not not to this not to this volume um there obviously have been um charges levied levied at clubs but not for this length of time that this is um that the charges relate to but also in relation to the length of time it has taken um for the um commission to be convened as I say um if these charges go back to 2009 um we're now in 2023 and the commission is being convened which is an independent commission it will be a private commission and but the result will be published and there may possibly be an appeal depending on the outcome um those sanctions that you've just mentioned are contained within um the Premier League's rules and regulations in in section 51 and those are the rules that they will have to apply to this um in in imposing a sanction um and Manchester City will have to comply with and cooperate with the commission um the independent commission will will take a dim view if they don't comply with that okay I'm I'm working this out on my feet here um and you're the expert so that I'm looking at the fifth sort of set on that Premier League statement the ones relating for 2018-19 season to this season and that's about failing to provide the information is it yeah that's right they're basically saying the financial charges relate to a club has to provide two sets of accounts has to provide up-to-date Financial accounts showing the previous year's um financial performance and then it has to provide future funding accounts which sets out where the club's finances are going to be going in in the future and that relates to the sustainability of the club and its compliance with financial fair play obviously the way for regulations are now called the um Financial sustainability rules rather than fair play but those charges relate mainly to the disclosing of information in those accounts the charges from that period you just described are where they're the Premier League are clearly investigating the matter and then they're asking for information in order for them to properly investigate it you mentioned the rule there B15 which is that effectively you have to act in good faith um not act dishonestly towards the Premier League and and your fellow um fellow clubs um in order to provide that information and you can't just say the information is confidential you have to disclose the information and so you would read from that there's there's been a certain element of frustration on the Premier League's part in in obtaining the information that it needs and as I say um we're now in 2023 they've been investigating this it would appear since at least 2017 because the charges relate to that period okay that's made that clearer thank you um I I wonder in in reading into these charges whether you can get any idea of whether these charges relate to either administrative errors or whether you can read into it that the charges are deliberate misconduct can you can you fathom that from these uh charges that we've seen today no I I I think it it in some respects it would be unprofessional to do that because um if if they are administrative errors then the sanction will be a slap on the wrists um given the um the fact that the commission will have to be um convened it will be convened I would think given the seriousness of the charges um it will have a legal representative on the panel and you would expect that League representative to be a pretty heavyweight um King's Council who understands these rules and regulations they will have to go through all of the information that's provided as I say Manchester City have had an obligation to comply with the Premier League's um uh Premier League's investigation they now have an obligation to comply with the commission's uh procedure and the information that the panel require in order to properly consider these charges um if obviously they don't comply then that a dim view will be taken in relation to that if they do comply and they provide the information then you would think that if the Premier League have taken it this far they either think that there is a case to answer or they've simply got to the point where they haven't been given the answers and they put it to a commission in order to get those answers okay um right so um we'll we'll get on to what type of punishments they could face in a moment because from what you're saying there this could take quite some time the investigation has been going on for an awfully long time and you're talking about convening this commission but I would think from both parties is is there a desire to get this through as quickly as possible and would that be possible to do well it's it's as you say it's um uh it's been going on for several years um the fact that the charges in relation to uh the accounts date back to 2009 um you would obviously expect that given this length of time now that a commission is being convened they will want this to be a proper uh Fair process and they will want the panel to be able to consider all of the relevant information as you say given the number of charges they're going to have to go through an awful lot of information in order to consider those charges there will be legal representation and representations made um in the first instance you would expect the commission to set out the procedure that will be adopted in relation to this under time scale um and then you will be they'll be holding the the hearing itself um these things take time to convene and because the panel has to effectively consider quite a lot of information and representations have to be made which could in part be in writing and also by an oral hearing and then they have to produce their written judgment which again can take time because they know that that written judgment will be scrutinized um considerably particularly in an appeal so that process unfortunately does take quite a bit of time yeah okay and when they reach their conclusion um if they find for the charges here what punishments can they doll out here well your infographic was very helpful there in relation to the scope of the um penalties that can be imposed that's self-contained within the rules and regulations um in the Premier League in in rule w51 um which as I say goes from effectively an admonishment to um potentially you know being suspended from the league and having points um deducted now if those points are to be deducted retrospectively in relation to the period that you've just described then what domino effect does that have in relation to um the outcome of the league at that particular time particularly when Manchester City won the league um if they simply decide that Manchester City um face a sanction but that sanction is to be imposed going forward um then there would there may be some form of a a significant fine but then obviously the question would be whether whether um your fine is sufficient punishment and a sufficient deterrent and and then um if there's a deduction of points when that period of points deduction is to be applied because that's been an issue for several um uh commissions um in in leagues such as the the championship league and what have you as to at what point you impose a penalty of of points and whether that has an effect in the season that you're currently in or in the future season because a deduction of points in a particular season might not actually have any effect overall in relation to the uh the standings for the club yeah I hear what you're saying to say it's um a tricky business Stephen thank you so much for coming on and making that clearer good thank you [Music],"The transcript discusses multiple alleged breaches of Premier League rules by Manchester City Football Club, focusing on financial and disclosure-related misconduct. Between 2009 and 2018, Manchester City allegedly failed to accurately report financial information, which is a significant breach given the league's requirement for clubs to provide a true and fair view of their financial position. The alleged violations include misreporting manager and player remuneration, failing to comply with UEFA's Club licensing and financial fair play regulations, not complying with rules on profitability and sustainability, and not cooperating with the Premier League's investigation into its finances. An independent commission will review these allegations, which are unprecedented in volume and duration.

Khaldoon Al Mubarak on $500m investment, Raheem Sterling & Premier League title race!","Khaldoon thank you firstly for speaking to Skyy oh no this is your only broadcast interview following today's news and it's big news it catapults the value of city football group to almost 5 billion dollars how big a validation is that of your strategy we're very excited thank you so much for allowing me on the show it's been a I think a wonderful journey over the last ten eleven years and I think this transaction is another testament to the journey that we've undertaken chef Mansour when he when he bought the club back in 2008 he bought it with it with it with a view that this is going to be a profitable sustainable business and I think we've done that over the last ten years we've shown that this thesis is accurate and it's right and I think this transaction is a is a further or a further testament to this to this thesis tell me have you had conversations with other investors what was it that led you to Silverlake in particular and what why they the right fit so Silverlake I think is a world-class investor we were we're delighted to have silver like part of the team here Silverlake is one of the global leaders in technology media sports and entertainment investing it's a US firm and you know we've quickly through the conversations we've had over the last couple of months came to conclusion that we're a good fit for each other I think they add a lot of value to the group and particularly as I look at the future and what we intend to do in the in the next ten years I think Silver Lake is the perfect fit I think for what they want with the type of investment that they're viewing city football group has proven to be again a very good fit for them so as well I think a very nice you know marriage between these two organizations you've invested significantly over the past ten years both the squad and the infrastructure here at the 8-yard thanks to the investment from Silver Lake you've got another five hundred million dollars how you're going to spend it well we've been focusing over the last ten years with a clear business plan a clear investment strategy a clear clear global strategy in terms of how we built out the group from one in Manchester City to a group of clubs around the world a world we are I think leaders today in the and the football business globally all these businesses are sustainable are profitable I think Manchester City is now five years in profitability so I think the sustainable model that we've been working on has proven to be a success and Silverlake sees that the investment you know this is 500 million dollars that Silverlake is is putting into the group and we're not taking any money out this investment money stays in the group stays as part of our growth strategy for the future and we will continue down the route that we've started ten years ago and as we look at the next chapter in this evolution which is the next 10 years and this this investment will will help fuel that growth going back to when you first started you were famously described as the noisy neighborhoods of your rivals on the other side of the city how big apart does this investment from Silver Lake play in bridging the financial gap with Manchester United you know Manchester United is a very successful organization has done that successfully over the years I'd rather not talk about other teams and other organization and really just focus about what we do and I think what we're doing is building a sustainable business a sustainable business that continues to grow continues to be successful both on and off the pitch and I look at what we've achieved over the 10 year last 10 years as a benchmark to build on for the next 10 years across the board in every single club that we have vested in the ownership still have the desire to invest to progress and if so what's a realistic target for Manchester City over the next say 10 years I think this transaction is a testament to the appetite that this group has about the future when we when we when we bring in another half a billion dollars of investment into the group and when we commit to keep that investment and not take out any of that I think that in itself tells you how we see investing and how we see the future we see this as a growing attractive business to invest in we've created the platforms for that and I certainly I think can assure you that we are focusing on the future we're focusing on growth and building on the strength that we've though that we've built over the years now of course in all of this there is a backdrop of an ongoing UEFA investigation the allegations against you have been widely publicized they are namely that you've circumvented Financial Fair Play regulations what you say to those allegations I think our position on this has been you know is very clear and we've made it I think explicit over the last couple of months and given that there's a process underway it's very important for me to respect that process therefore I think it's not appropriate for me to comment other than we're respecting the process and we're going through the steps I understand you can't get drawn on specifics but are you confident that the club will be cleared my position has been consistent on this and on the record and clear okay let's get back to matters on the pitch Raheem Sterling he's often spoken about now in the same breath there's an elite band of footballers namely the likes of Lionel Messi Cristiano Ronaldo beside a new contract last year what can you do to ensure that Raheem is part of Manchester City's long-term future I'm very proud of what Raheem has done over the last couple years his evolution as a player but more importantly as a person I think has been has been exceptional he's become a leader both on and off the pitch he's become a leader in this squad at Manchester City he's been a leader at England serving his country and I think he's been a leader in the community so I'm so happy for him because I think he's a he's a he's a wonderful young young man and I think he's his talent listen he there's one thing I'm sure of Raheem is only going to improve and only gonna grow as both a player and a leader so you know the future is I think very right for him and it's certainly a pleasure to have him Palomar to you let's talk about that team for a minute you look set to progress out of the group stages at the Champions League you're in another epic title race are you concerned there's too much ground to make up on Liverpool have you spoken to the players about it and if you have is there a belief that they can retain the title again this team is a is a special team I think what's been accomplished over the last two seasons to be specific is is special you know a hundred ninety eight points over two seasons back-to-back Premier League titles a 4-peat last year I mean this is really what's been accomplished you have to you know just hats off for everyone involved in this in this organization and I think you know we've shown time and time again this team is shown time and time again that you cannot write them off this is a committed team a disciplined team a hard-working team with an exceptional manager I think in pep we have a leader that has shown time and time again his ability to continuously evolve and continuously challenge and we've been in this position and not once but many times before and we've shown the character always consistently to to come back so I think you know the Premier League is a very very challenging league it's it's why we all love this league and winning it for the last two seasons is is one of the most challenging endeavors a that any person in sports can do so no doubt I think the challenge is there we're up for it still a long way to go still in November and we'll see where we end up in May but certainly we're up for it it's interesting cuz I'm hearing you speak about pep hearing you know everyone at this club speaking about him how central he is to things here he led Barcelona for four years he was a by him for three years he's been at City for three years how confident are you in his longevity if you had any guarantees that he's going to be here for many years to come you know Pep has been an incredible asset to this organization he's you know we can speak about his managerial accomplishments for hours but I think as a person as an individual as a friend he's been he's been a you know a core part of what we've accomplished over here over the last three years he's very committed we're committed to him you've seen his interviews just I think a couple of days ago we have a great relationship we have a great environment here the people around him the team we have in place today the relationships I have with him you know this is really an environment that is conducive for success for both him and and everybody involved in this organization I'm very satisfied with the with his commitment and our commitment to him and I'm looking forward to to the continuity of this for years to come let's bring it back if we can to today's news that the valuation now of City football group is massive how much is pep guardiola and his achievements at manchester city a part of that valuation perhaps achievements I think no doubt our integral he is and what we've accomplished over the last couple years is remarkable and that is ahead I think an overwhelming influence for the whole group but I think pep will be the first one to say that this is a team effort this is a wonderful organization we have a group all over the world we have you know we have 1500 players plus all over the world part of this group over 2,000 employees globally that play you know we have our teams playing over 2,500 games every year so this is a you know a magnificent organization with people all over the world working together successful clubs from Manchester to New York to Melbourne to Yokohama Japan to India you know India obviously is another market that we're looking at our talk about it in a second so you know this is a team effort that's one of the things I'm most proud of that we have truly an a team across the board and that's been reflected in this valuation and reflected in how a world khakha world-class a u.s. investor is putting a five hundred million dollars into this organization at the valuation we're talking about that's a testament to the the strength and sustainability of this organization almost next to the organization as we briefly touched on there's been talk of a club in India is that close to happening I mean listen we've looked what you look at growth we look at three markets three major markets the United States China and India and we've invested obviously as you know in New York and that's how US presence in MLS we've invested in China and certainly India is the next big market that that we'd like to have a position in that's that's been public so I hope very soon you know we'll be able to to make our move into that market and continue our growth trajectory in the right markets globally so potentially there could be other clubs on the horizon you know you've seen what we've done over the last ten years you've seen how we've grown I think we will continuously look at the right opportunities and grow in the right way in the sustainable way and the profitable way for the group kaldane thank you thank you very much","The interview with Khaldoon Al Mubarak,

it marked a new all-time low in an era of long-term decline the peak slab but constantly underperforming described if I remember correct is a theater of comedy was that main road you know which was doing very well alongside the theatre of Dreams elsewhere people talk about a losing culture you know I think it was more that the club and the players that were probably feeling somewhat sorry for themselves you know this can't happen was were too good for this Francis Lee a legendary player from their glory days had returned as chairman to try to bring back the good times to Main Road but a succession of managers had been unable to hold the slide I think there was that many different managers that mean nuclear's getting same players are they'd already that didn't have a future and you know the whole atmosphere was about poison really and that about translated onto the fans as well Joe Royle another ex City Star faced the challenge of trying to turn things around the big advantage I had was I played there and played probably in in the best side before now I had a city background which I think gave me time with the fans at Maine Road average gates of over 28,000 expected city to escape from what is now lead one but the first time of asking my mindset was we're gonna bunch right back we're gonna you know we're going to do well we're gonna win two out of three games I really had this this I don't know fall solution that we we do not not easy but we'd be alright in terms of get promoted straight away but a three nil defeated Fulham in their second game of the season was a reality check whenever we went anywhere and it was a 4-month city in town sort of thing and everybody raised their game and we found that difficult to cope with particularly in the in the first few months it is the via for month you know because of every single game and whoever it was were playing against that was their biggest game of the season by Christmas Manchester City had slipped to their lowest ever league position 12th in footballs third tier and credited or discredited with the phrase city Isis and city Isis was that just when you think nothing you can get worse he usually dead for me the lowest point would have been New York away we lost to one that was actually suspended the Lockean and then I remember result coming in and I was sent at home and just thinking you may have blown it a 2-1 win against Stoke in late December proved to be pivotal that was the moment because from then on I was also improved and we began to get that momentum that was so important to us unfriend and Ryan frankly we've had that momentum now for by and large for 20 years in the playoffs they faced Wigan it looked like things might still go man I don't think a weekend player touch the ball until Thank You Stuart Barlow he nipped in scored so after sort of 22 seconds 30 seconds whatever you're already thinking oh here we go again typical sort of city we've got there and and we're gonna throw it away in a 10 second leg Shaun gotas goal would be enough to take city to Wembley I think everyone sort of remembers my girls against United but I think that if you don't get into that foreigner who knows so in terms of importance there's probably my most important though the need to be trilling him in the final could not be downplayed I felt before he started it was gonna be the most important game in the club's history the club was really going to progress we had to win that game but with four minutes to go city were to nil down and looking destined to fail this is it this is City Isis all over again who knows what have you done to is why did we deserve this Kevin whole lot pulled a goal back then deep into stoppage time one final chance fell to portico [Applause] the bizarre thing for me as it wasn't even a golden one was the game no he it just got us back into the game penalties would decide the outcome the stage was set for city's young keeper Nikki Weaver to be the hero [Applause] degenerates I can feel this just slightly electricity moving through my body and so I sort of did want it to end so I thought well I got from a room so it was just unbelievable and it's sort of that I think the other overriding emotion was just relief because it was we've sort of done it and the way we've done it would sort of come back from the dead and it was just typical so a city when I was like you and and yeah it was a I can't believe it's almost twenty years after years of decline city fans finally had something to shout about that they just can't believe what's happening a Manchester City now but they still remember that season with a smile and funnily enough they don't have any of the angst that we had at the time they just say it was great it was great well we should have known 20 years on they still celebrate the season when city stopped the rot and paved the way for what's become an extraordinary new era","The transcript narrates the challenging period in the history of Manchester City Football Club during their time in the third tier of English football. It begins by describing the club's decline post its glory days, highlighting the sense of underperformance and a losing culture that was prevalent at Manchester City. The period featured management instability and a toxic atmosphere that felt pervasive among fans and players alike. Under Joe Royle's leadership, there was a glimmer of hope to bounce back, with high expectations from their large fan base, despite realizing the challenges reality presented as evidenced by consecutive defeats, including a pivotal 3-0 loss to Fulham and a low point loss to York City. A turning point came with a late December win against Stoke, initiating momentum that carried them through to the playoffs against Wigan, culminating in a momentous victory at Wembley after a dramatic comeback, including noteworthy goals from Shaun Goater and Paul Dickov. This victory marked a pivotal moment in stopping the decline and laid the foundation for the club’s future successes, much to the delight of their fans who now fondly recall that crucial season.",Other,0,No,Manchester City ownership,UAE
hPmf0oSGZtM,EXPLAINED: Man City's financial charges hearing | 'Everything is on the line!',our chief reporter carve solal is with us carve it's been a long wait for this hearing to start what have they been accused of you could break that down for us first well I mean uh these are very very serious charges the most serious charges are that across u nine Seasons Manchester City uh failed to provide accurate financial information uh and also that across nine Seasons they failed to provide accurate financial information about manager and player contracts they're also accused of breaking uefa's Financial fair play uh rules across Five Seasons also accused of breaking uh the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules uh across three seasons uh and also failing to cooperate with the Premier League's investigation so I think it's fair to say that this is the biggest trial of its kind that we've ever seen uh in English football and this Premier League inves ation has been going on now for almost 6 years and this whole case really started because a young Portuguese computer expert decided to start hacking into the emails of clubs and agents across Europe uh and the information that he basically illegally accessed ended up in the hands of a German uh newspaper it feels like there's so much on the line here what's state for Manchester City but also for for the premier league as well well uh if we start with Manchester City I think everything is on the line uh because it is undeniable that under Pep Guardiola they have become one of the most incredible teams and clubs World football has ever seen but always there have been those people who have been saying okay yes what they're doing on the pitch is incredible but what have they been doing off the pitch have they been breaking the financial rules have they been spending more money than they should have been spending and I think if they're found guilty of these charges then of course people are going to look back at their successes and say okay they won all these titles but you need to put a little asterisk next to them and also what's at stake is you know the punishment that they could get is unlimited uh you know this commission can uh punish them in whatever way they see fit so for instance uh you know I don't want to scare people but they could be relegated they could be expelled from the Premier League or they may be fined but of course they may be cleared as well the three person commission uh may decide that you know none of these uh charges allegations are proven and uh clear them for the Premier League what's at stake is their credibility and also this whole system of financial regulation we've seen for instance clubs like uh Leicester win appeals against the Premier League as well I think that hurts The credibility of the Premier League's Financial rules but if Manchester City were to win this I think there would be serious questions asked about uh the Premier League's handling of this whole case and also the Premier League's Financial rules people would be saying are these rules fit for purpose something that always comes up is how long is this going to take and also will we know much about what's going on throughout the process unfortunately um we won't know anything I've got a pretty good idea about where the hearing is today in London uh but the hearing is secret nobody is allowed in there unless you're one of the lawyers uh so I would love to be able to say that journalists would be allowed in so we could go in and Report what is happening but we are not allowed to do that is being held behind closed doors those are the Premier League's uh rules as to how long it would take I think this hearing will probably take about 10 weeks uh it could take longer than that but then I think after that it will take months before we get the verdict uh from uh the commission and then you have to factor in that either side can appeal as well so we could have the appeal process could take another six months so I think we could be you know looking at months and months and months if not a year uh for this to be all over and also I don't want to upset you but I think pretty much when it's over there aren't going to be any winners uh because I think even if Manchester City were to be found guilty of these charges uh I still think they would maintain their innocence and I'm pretty sure their fans would still maintain their innocence as well and I think if Manchester City were cleared there is still a lot of football fans out there who would say Okay they've got great lawyers who manag to you know argue something and get them off on a technicality uh but we know what they've been up to so I think this case is going to run and run the really disappointing thing about it is that we're not allowed to report on what is happening uh because I think what why why shouldn't there be sort of open Justice you know if Manchester City have got nothing to hide why can't we go in there and Report uh you know the facts that would potentially clear them uh but as I said it's the Premier League's rules it says in the rule books this is the process and the hearings are held behind closed doors yeah [Music] [Music] [Applause],"The transcript covers the ongoing investigation and hearing involving Manchester City, accused of breaching financial regulations over several seasons. Charges include providing inaccurate financial data and violating UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules. The trial, stemming from information accessed through the hacking of emails, is a significant event in English football. The potential consequences for Manchester City are severe, ranging from fines to expulsion from the Premier League if found guilty. The hearing is secretive, with no public or media access, possibly hindering transparency. The proceedings could take up to a year or more, and even if the case concludes, public perception may remain skeptical regardless of the outcome.

CF_0c3hRV9w,What punishments could Manchester City face? | Premier League allege 101 rules broken,let's start though with a day of unprecedented action from the Premier League who have charged Manchester City with over a 100 breaches of its Financial fair play rules the Premier League champions say they're surprised and insist they're innocent the case has been referred to an independent commission to decide any potential punishment well according to the Premier League Manchester City allegedly broke the rules over nine Seasons it's claim they didn't provide accurate financial information during those nine Seasons city won the Premier League title three times well here's a breakdown of exactly what city are accused of it's more than a hundred breaches of financial Fairplay rules between 2009 and 2018 eight charges relate to the terms and content of the former manager Roberto manini's contract the Premier League alleges that City failed to show the full amount that was paid 12 charges relate to player contracts and the full amounts not being included between 2009 and 2013 the premier league has leveled five other charges alleging that every year from 2013 to 2018 City failed to comply with UFA rules which include Club licensing and financial fair play regulations the premier league has similar rules governing what clubs can spend and they've charged City with 25 br breaches of those rules between 2015 and 2018 the final 30 charges go from 2018 right up to the current season and alleged that by failing to supply documents in good faith I.E accurately and on time City didn't cooperate with or assist the league in its investigation well our chief reporter carve solol right across this story and joins me now as you can see how do we get here good question uh it started off with a uh hacker Portuguese hacker called ruy Pinto who hacked into the emails of some of the biggest clubs in Europe and also uh some of the biggest football agents uh the information that he stole he gave to a German magazine called Dash beagle uh they did a series of Articles called football leaks investigations uh and once these investigations were read and digested a lot of people said come on look at all this evidence UEFA has to do something UEFA has to charge Man City with breaking their financial fair play rules that is what UEFA did uh basically Man City were find guilty then they went to the court of arbitration for sport uh they partially overturned uh some of uh uefa's decisions which meant for instance they were supposed to be banned from European competition for two seasons that was overturned but they would still find 10 million Eur down from €30 million at the same time when people read what was in Desh beagle they said hey Premier League have got Financial fair play rules as well why are the Premier League not investigating the Premier League started investigating they started investigating just over four years ago uh in the background there have been court cases where uh Manchester City have argued that the Premier League don't have the power to uh investigate these financial matters uh but the Premier League have been pretty dogged and we got to the situation today totally unprecedented and pretty extraordinary a situation that a lot of people didn't think they would ever see where the Premier League appears to be taking on one of the biggest most powerful clubs if not the biggest and the most powerful Club in the Premier League at the moment as you said this is unprecedented why only Manchester City well why he Manchester city that is the evidence that's been presented to the Premier League the Premier League would tell you that they have uh strict Financial fair play rules and if any other clubs uh break those rules if they receive evidence that seems to show that they're breaking those rules then the Premier League would take action against them as well as far as UEFA is concerned it hasn't just been Manchester City uh other clubs have been investigated other clubs have been sanctioned and fined including clubs like AC Milan and PSG as well so it hasn't just been Manchester City now City have uh been faced with these questions before the city chairman calun Alma Barak has spoken out against Financial Fairplay concerns in the past actually in an interview in 2019 he insisted that if the process is based solely on fact City will prevail we are dealing with each one of these uh entities uh uh asper the process uh we have clear answ um I believe quite comfortably if the uh the process is going to be judged on facts then unquestionably uh we will prevail uh if it's not about facts and it's about other things then it's a different conversation so that was 2019 what have City had to say today well let's go to the ettihad stadium join our reporter Vinnie o Conor and find out so Vinnie what have they said officially Mike there's shock also behind the scenes the zanger as well in a statement this afternoon Manchester City had this to say Manchester City FC is surprised by the issuing of these alleged breaches of the Premier League rules particularly given the extensive engagement and vast amount of detailed materials that the eppl has been provided with the club welcomes the review of this matter by an independent commission to impartially consider the comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence that exists in support of its position as such we look forward to this matter being being put to rest once and for all where the anger comes from there's a couple of points to raise here first of all the timing we understand has been noted by those behind the scenes in relation that is to the soon to be released white paper on football governance and the prospect of an independent regulator coming into the sport City believe in many ways they're being used as an as an example of the Premier League being able to keep its own house in order on top of that there's also unhappiness over allegations that over the way the news was delivered to Manchester city today they believe that journalists were brief before they were given the information and also it's it's claimed that the news was delivered to Manchester City in a telephone call to their CEO Fen Sano while that telephone call was taking place that was when the news was made public what Manchester City do welcome is the fact that there's no time bar uh as you carve mentioned the process that they went through as regards UEFA and the court of arbitration for sport that could only go back 5 years the fact that this goes back to 2009 then Manchester City Welcome the opportunity to prove their innocence across that time scale Vinnie for the moment thank you very much um carve um Vinnie picked up on a couple of things that City have said they talked about the white paper and how they feel it's a bit of a smoke screen and also that journalists were briefed is that your understanding on both those well look uh Vinnie um you know he has got excellent information um there are two sides to the story my understanding slightly different from Vinnie's I'm not contradicting what he's saying uh but my information is that uh as far as the Premier League concerned we should not be reading anything into the timing of this coinciding with the possibility that the government are going to be releasing this white paper which may well uh recommend the setting up and an independent football regulator uh so my understanding of the situation is the two are to toally unconnected the timing of this is not something underhand by the Premier League to try and show off to the government look we're so powerful we're taking action against Manchester City we don't need an independent regulator although I can see why it could look like that okay and we're journalist on the second point about the journalist being briefed again my understanding is that no journalists were briefed before the statement was published on the Premier League's website uh and I'm not 100% sure I think what happened is that the first people to report it uh were the Times newspaper website and that is because somebody on their news desk saw it on the Premier League's website so I am pretty sure no journalists were briefed if they had been briefed they would have been on social media straight away because it would have been a a great exclusive breaking story uh but my understanding is the first time uh anybody knew about it was when it appeared on the Premier League's website okay let's um just reiterate that as things stand City been found guilty of absolutely nothing but if they are we're going to talk possible punishments carve and I'm going to throw some possible punishments at you and see what you think could City be fined in the past clubs have been fined for breaking Financial fair play rules both here and abroad uh Queens Park Rangers find 50 million uh they've had to pay nearly all that fine it's affected them to this day had a massive effect on the way the club is run would a financial penalty if city were found guilty really hurt them or would it just be a slap on the wrist a lot of people would say that Manchester City's owners are so rich uh that a fine of 10 20 30 40 50 million pound wouldn't really have that much of an effect on them so that would be maybe the best case scenario after of course being totally cleared okay points deduction again we've seen points deductions be applied especially uh in the efl it has happened on numerous occasions uh I've seen people saying today if there were points deductions would they be historic points deductions would they go back for instance to 2009 could we see the Premier League table being redrawn and trophies being taken away from Manchester City again I don't have a crystal ball but in the past uh especially in England that has not happened there has been a real reluctance to get involved with changing uh results and changing League tables from the past so if there was to be a points deduction I think it would be much more likely to be applied in the season where the decision was made that Manchester City were guilty of breaking these rules okay could they be expelled from the league again it's a possibility if you look at the uh various options that the uh commission independent commission has they can recommend uh to the Premier League board that a club are expelled from the league if that was to happen basically Manchester City would be relegated again I think that is one of the worst case scenarios I think it would be a very very difficult decision for the Premier League board to take to relegate one of their richest more powerful uh members but again if you look at at the rule book it's on there the independent commission have the power to recommend expulsion to the Premier League board one more for you could City suffer a transfer ban again that is possible uh the football leaks investigation uh the material that was published in Desh beagle seemed to suggest that Manchester City had broken rules about uh approaching young players something that Manchester City have denied so again if this was looked at by the Premier League and they decided that Manchester City had broken some of these rules then they could be punished the Premier League could say you're not allowed to register players which should effectively mean that they were banned uh from making signings I mean going through all this this is all hypothetical you know Le let's bear in mind Manchester City as you said have not been found guilty of anything they may well be totally cleared we're just going through the Poss outcomes if they are found guilty according to the Premier League's own rule book how significant is it that there's no appeal process well there is there is an appeals process uh I've got to make that clear I think quickly I can go through what's going to happen next what will happen next is that the Premier League board has referred the case to a man called muray Rosen KC now he is the chair of the Premier League judicial panel what he will do now is establish a threepers panel he will choose three people to sit on this independent commission and these three people will hear representations from the Premier League and also from Manchester City in secret in private we don't know where it's going to be we don't know how long it will take once they've heard the representations and come to their decision that decision will be published on the Premier League's website that's how we'll find out what the decision is now there is an appeals process either side can appeal that decision in that case what would happen happened is Mari Rosen KC again he would get to work he would uh establish a new three-person panel made up of three different people and they would hear the appeal and once they'd heard the appeal again their decision would be published on the Premier League's website what city would not be able to do which is what they did in the UEFA case is they went to the court of arbitration for sport they they would not they would not be able to do that okay [Music],"The transcript outlines the unprecedented actions taken by the Premier League against Manchester City, accusing the club of over 100 breaches of

The case, involving inaccurate financial disclosures and contractual discrepancies, has been referred to an independent commission for review. Key allegations include the failure to accurately report manager and player contract payments and non-compliance with UEFA regulations.

AwC1J9o9Wxk,The details of Manchester City's 115 charges hearing,it's been years in the making and now arguably England's English football's largest and most controversial case has a start date yes the Premier League's long awaited hearing into Manchester City's 115 alleged charges will begin on Monday Sam Wallace and Jonathan Lou joined us on Back Pages tonight last night and agreed it is Paramount a resolution is found it's the single biggest issue currently in English football certainly it's what preoccupies the Premier League and and Manchester City it's serial champions uh it's the biggest legal case I suppose youd say outside of those that have been fought in the courts around football but certainly in terms of football's regulatory authorities most of those fall most of the government football falls upon the EA but this one is is in the Premier League's Court it is hard to understate just how important this is and and the implications are huge either way there were so many you know thorny you know potential conflicts of interest to be sidestepped and and it's essentially had to to assemble an apparatus to fight this case almost from scratch because it it is you know historically been quite quite a small you know streamlined body without the um you know without the means necessar to fight a litigation of this scale and it is like unbelievably complex in scale so I think when we look back at this we we're going to wonder how it got to a point where the premier league has basically had had to fight a case of this magnitude in a competition which is also running and promoting and marketing and and how safeguards and and you know institutional measures can be put in place that we don't get into a situation like this again so marks in situ at the screen different subject more serious subject really complex case lots of potential ramifications this will help break it down for us so what are Manchester City charged with yeah this has been going on for a number of months and years and like you rightly say is a very complex situation hence why it's taken this period of time just to get to the start of the hearing which we know begins on Monday and could go on for some time now the reason why we're at this place is because Manchester City have been charged um 115 alleged charges by the Premier League for failing to meet their PSR Financial requirements and they've broken the rules allegedly they have been said to fail fail to provide accurate information over a 9year spell which goes from 20 9 to 2018 in which they won three Premier League titles they've also been charged as well by subverting you wa for ffp rules which is the uh Premier League's version of PSR ffp is the same thing but that's what you wafer call it there are 115 charges in total uh allegedly they've not fully disclosed Financial renumeration to a former manager they've not cooperated on a number of issues and ch charges and when the Premier League have gone to Manchester City and said we need this information they failed to deliver it the 115 charges are not5 separate charges there will be some of those charges that are the same charge for example failing to provide information once twice three times and so on is the same charge but there could be multiple versions of the same charge so that's a in a nutshell what they've been charged with okay so bullet point to what what could happen to the Club there are various things that obviously could happen they could be found not guilty they could walk away without any charges any punishments whatsoever however that looks very unlikely at this stage with the number of charges and the length of time it's taken to get to this point there could be points deductions there could be fines there could even be expulsion from the Premier League however I would suggest that is a very unlikely think at this stage that would be the most extreme punishment that they could face and and the other thing to to point out is that this potentially could go on for six seven eight months this is something that will start on Monday but may go on for some time okay key thing is time frame I guess it's a lot of charges isn't it to to get through a lot of work is going to be needed to be done when will a decision be made now the initial hearing is expected to take up to two months so that takes us into November after then Manchester City could say we don't agree with this we don't agree with your findings and we don't agree with what you've said in the last two months so therefore we are going to appeal therefore it could even go into February March or April next year depending on that appeal process if Manchester City do decide to appeal so it's very likely it will be towards the back end of this season before we find out exactly what the outcome is of Monday's hearing [Music],"The transcript discusses the upcoming Premier League hearing concerning Manchester City, accused of breaching 115 financial regulations over nearly a decade, including failing to provide accurate information and subverting Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. The case is regarded as the most significant legal issue in English football due to its magnitude and the potential ramifications for Manchester City and the Premier League. The complexity of the case is highlighted, as the Premier League has had to build the capacity to address it, indicating the unusual scale and gravity of the situation. The potential outcomes range from Manchester City being found not guilty to points deductions, fines, or possibly even expulsion from the league. The proceedings are expected to begin imminently and may extend several months into the next year, should appeals arise.",Financial Ethics in Sports,-1,No,,UAE
t1dRiZJsXDY,Football Finance Expert Claims Manchester City Will Be RELEGATED If Guilty Of Their FFP Charges,Simon is to my right and in studio with us just now and the man himself is getting a huge reaction here at talk sport football Finance expert formerly uh advising clubs such as Manchester city is football Finance expert Stephan borson Stephanie you're actually a real expert in the field of litigation I I I know that um you advis Manchester City what were you advis them about uh well I advise City from about 2001 to 2007 uh so that's when we had no money at all so uh one of one of our deals bur yeah that sort of time alist McIntosh was CEO that that point um and John Wardle was chairman I remember at that point uh and clearly the club was living a little bit hand to mouth at that point in the way that a number of clubs are are today uh one of the deals that we did we ended up doing a said and Lease back on the club shop for three million quid you know that's the sort of that that's where the club was uh in terms of its need for cash incredible and ultimately my my final uh transaction for them uh was the auction process uh before the man saw one so uh when we we ended up selling to tax in Shino which I can see Simon is already smiling about uh but you know the reality is sometimes you have to do deals that you wouldn't ordinarily want to do um and city were in that kind of position at that time now clearly that transaction ultimately didn't go well but it it went well to the extent that that owner was able to access buyers that we weren't able to access despite a very very public auction and that's why we ended up in the hands of um of shik Mansour um a year later I see so your time at city was as as advisor was pre Shake mansur just so we can establish that so when we come to talk about Manchester City and the 115 charges that they face everybody seems Stephan to hit something of a brick wall um in front of the dcms the other day Richard Masters uh top man at the Premier League was saying yes a date has been set for the hearing regarding the charges that face Manchester City but it won't tell us when you've got your ear to the ground haven't you when is it Stephan well I I don't know when it is because all anybody knows is what there's a piece from Mike Keegan um why would that compromise anything well it doesn't compromise anything but you know so why wouldn't Masters reveal it well first of all there there is uh strict confidentiality uh Clauses within the Premier League rule so I assume that's what he's got in mind in saying he can't comment when it is but there is a ludicrous situation that we have right now where we have this situation ongoing and at some point at someday that nobody knows you know nobody knows exactly when an announcement is going to drop again we don't know whether it's going to be in the morning or the afternoon there's going to be an enormous announcement that that completely changes I would would say completely changes Premier League football like what either way like what well either that either that City have been cleared yeah or uh for me as a city fan and we you haven't revealed that yet uh but somebody that's objective I I would like to think you know to to to to the extent that anybody can be and I think you know football bias is a very strong thing and objective we we have to did I say biased you said subjective subjective yeah no no objective um you know we all try and be as objective as possible but um you know and that that's what I'll try and be in our discussion about City but but you know the consequences of of city of the charges being proven are obviously enormous for the club and uh and enormous for the fans I mean so uh you know the idea that the Premier League can say nothing until some Mystery Date sometime in the future can say literally nothing that's their plan at the moment no timetable no indication of actually what the allegations are beyond that list I mean I've worked you know quite hard you seen the charges well no I've seen the charge sheet that everybody's seen but I you know I'm able to decipher it because of my knowledge of previous cases and joining some of the dots and and you know and some of some of the things I've written public on that um and so I understand the case but most people don't understand the case because why would they it has never been explained to them and Richard Master sits there and and says well we we've agreed today you know it is similar though to the case that UEFA ran isn't it I think it's very similar to to the case that the UEFA ran and that's a and that's it's a simple argument that can be easily explained which is that shareholders are funding the football club through concocted sponsorship deals inflating those sponsorship deals representing them as sponsorship Revenue when really it's Equity money going into the business so you're representing EAD or ESAT that were major sponsors during this period of time putting X amounts of tens of millions of pounds in on sponsorship deals which aren't what they say they are they're actually funding coming from another business called ad Adu which is Shake man business that's what the accusation is well the accusation I mean City wrote themselves you know if you look at because it is similar to the cast I mean City wrote themselves the allegations made in these proceedings are serious and based on fraud and conspiracy involving City add the sponsors etti salot and etti had you know this is these are serious allegations of Fraud and dishonesty it would require a conspiracy and and that is the word City use these are not my words these are City's words it's an allegation of Fraud and conspiracy that's been made by the Premier League against multiple parties and by UEFA and one of which and one of which U we try make this convicted them off understandable well yes but of course they did they charged them they did they did they did however of course Cass overturned it and said uh over 10 times there was no evidence for the for I'm just trying to break this down for for the Layman of whom I'm one so Stephan here we go you've said that in the months to come maybe weeks and months to come a day probably will materialize when there will be an announcement out the blue regards Manchester city either the charges are dropped and life goes on or presumably the alternative City are bang in trouble yeah well not dropped I mean I think you know any of compared to Everton and nauy and Forest what what's the scale of the trouble the scale is on a completely different level I mean it's there could be no question that uh that this will end in um well at least relegation right so there's no question if if those charges are proven that there a suggestion of of conspiracy over over effectively 10-year period you know they're suggesting that City's main sponsorship Agreements are not for let's say 50 60 million but are actually for 8 million million p and the whole thing was a sham and a whole load of people lied and a whole load of Executives from multiple uh companies were in on it and interest in common ownership well well actually some of them outside of common ownership but but a number of people were were also vested interest them vested interest perhaps um and that the club also lied to multiple other parties professionals uh people doing due diligence on the on the company uh the league UEFA uh the fa uh you know goes on and on they just they just blatantly refuse to cooperate to such a point that they got sanctioned even by C well no that's that's a separate point I mean you if you look at the C judgement there's a Ted acceptance from everybody that's dealt with them including the Premier League that there was a blatant refusal and even in uea's judgment followed up by cass's judgment there was a absolute unequivocal acceptance that they've been charged with a an absolute refusal to cooperate yeah got a 10 million fine the these are separate matters so there is a a situation of refusal it goes to the heart of what you're saying which is the provision of information and people being people being prepared to provide information in certain ways and their integrity being compromised if you're stying the flow of information then there is an element of the manner in which you behave puts you in a situation where people can't get clear pictures I I don't agree with that I think you have to separate two things you have to separate the Battle of very serious allegations and the litigation that surrounds it and I I've been involved in in uh in in English litigation regarding allegations of dishonesty not against myself as have I um not not against myself I don't know about no I put one against one of the most difficult cases misrepresentation know so so so frudia misrepresentation is a good example you will know how hard people fight about disclosure of documents about every inch of the way to try and sty me the other side that is a normal approach to to high value High profile litigation there is nothing in itself wrong with that and and I think that that any innuendo or inference that comes from that is wrong now I'm not saying they didn't breach the rules of UA for in terms of their cooperation they clearly did and they were fine for it but to be perfectly honest with you it's not that big a deal compared to the charges that have been led by the Premier League Char the charges here Stephan if I can pick up up on it if they are found guilty of the charges that they will face that they are facing Manchester City will face at least relegation well it's just hard to see how it can be any other way because you will have confirmed that that if proven and you know I don't believe that the Premier League will be able to prove a case of this nature in an independent commission I think it's a completely inappropriate forum for a case of this nature but if proven this is super serious I mean there could be no nobody would argue with that City themselves in their submissions I promise you because they've said it to cast they will say this is a this is a an allegation of the most serious nature Manchester City say robustly they will clear their name do you think they will I think they'll clear their name because I think a case of this Nature has to have a level of of cogent proof which seems to me to be impossible to present to to Independent commission and furthermore and furthermore it seems to me highly unlikely that the conduct that is alleged has taken place over a 10-year period with the sorts of individuals that are involved in in the club and in the companies that are involved it seems to me highly unlikely and that also will be the starting point of any independent commission whether whether Simon likes it or not that is their starting point and it will be a very big call for any uh quazi Court tribunal to uh to suggest that this number of people have been dishonest and have purged themselves that will be a massive call for a effectively some uh some cases and maybe a former Finance director of a football club to to make against not just uh Manchester City but against numerous Executives against uh some third party individuals um and against of course uh potentially uh uh uh um um senior members of foreign with

on da via the talk sport app and on your smart speaker talk sport,"The transcript is a detailed discussion on Manchester City's financial dealings, particularly around accusations of inflated sponsorship deals, allegations of fraud, and conspiracy tied to Sheikh Mansour's takeover. Stephan Borson, a former advisor to Manchester City, discusses the serious charges the club faces from the Premier League, which echo past accusations from UEFA. The conversation highlights the complex nature of the accusations, the challenges of the legal processes involved, and the implications for the club, including possible relegation. Borson emphasizes the difficulty of proving such allegations and asserts his belief that the charges may not hold up due to the complexity and the individuals involved. However, the inability of the Premier League to disclose details about the hearing further complicates the matter, as does the assumption that transparency hasn't been evident throughout the process. The transcript portrays a consequential scenario for Manchester City, with an emphasis on the potential impact on the club's future depending on the outcome of the charges.",Financial Ethics in Sports,-1,No,Manchester City ownership,UAE
tNdOw-yNIUM,"Khaldoon Al Mubarak Exclusive Interview | The Chairman on success, Guardiola, transfers and more!",Sherman here we are again round five or six of our they leave come on ten bite is it done thank you for inviting us to your home you moved house since we last saw him we've tracked you down so it really is no escape and we got into business how satisfying was the season a Grand Slam of English trophies well it's never been done before you cannot be but extremely satisfied we set a lot of targets at the beginning of the season and to go compete in every competition that we participate in and to win every single one of them apart from one I think is exceptional is absolutely exceptional I'm so proud of what's been accomplished it's it's really tremendous a credit to every part of this organization every member of this organization is part of the success is it possible to compare the 200 points and the 98 points and which gave you most pleasure different pleasure I think you know 100 points that season was as you know exceptional historic the records we set in that season but you look back at this season and getting 98 points which was so much harder so much harder from every aspect because we were playing again in all competitions this year we managed to win effectively three plus one three plus one I'll call it three plus one and to do so with essentially a competitor that that was you know head-to-head with us till the last minute of the season this was an incredibly difficult season incredibly challenging so it's a different type I mean last year if you remember it for a hundred points we kind of breezed through the last last two months in terms of the Premier League this year was different now this year there was no breezing through this was essentially since January first every game was a final every game was a final so the level of stress and pressure that we had to live with for a couple of months was it was quite quite and I mean you feel that tension as well I mean the players can do something about it I guess certain the stands none of those can do you actually feel that tension yeah I do feel it but I think I'm a lot more cool about it now I think over the years I've learned to deal with it a lot better and and this year particularly we were in a good standing in the Carrabelle cup and I knew that we handled that well FA Cup was the same I think wasn't as much pressure going through that in the Champions League it was challenging but it was it was okay the Premier League was different the Premier League if you had told me back then that we would have to have won 14 games in a row to win the league yeah that would have been different type of pressure I I knew it was gonna be tight but I didn't expect to be honest that the way it was gonna play out that we needed to win every single one of those last 14 Premier League games to actually win the league how much interaction in that time did you have with pepper he's real luck I work very closely with pepper it closely with oil with the team and Pep was very throughout this period I would say very focused extremely focused almost a machine has done this before in the Premier League has done this before in the Spanish league and the German league so we were you know many of our players have dealt with that for that pressure we have a lot of you know players as you know who were there in 2012 and that season in that game so we have a lot a wealth of experience and that's helped us all out this season so enough without background how disappointing was it to go out of the Champions League not necessarily that stays but in the way we I mean listen cup competitions are different you know leagues are marathons and in a marathon ultimately the best team wins most of the time to get 100 points followed that up by an by 98 points that's that's consistency and that's you know that's that's how you win league's Cup competitions are different there's a there's a whole different set of things that have to fall in place in a cup competition you need to be excellent every game and you need an element of luck you need an element of things you know working out you know you need to have the right calls made to your advantage that day not the calls made against you you need that penalty to go in when you rather than missing that penalty you need that two inches that we did everything there's no question in my mind we did everything in that series in these two games against Tottenham nevertheless the result ended up the Tottenham going through and that happens that happens in Cup competition and that's that's the thing I think that I've and I think we should all come to grips with is when it comes to the Champions League we will keep trying and we will win it and I assume the priorities won't change them I assume it will be go for all for trying we know for you know I had a conversation with the iottery I think on on the was it the first year we signed them and he was telling me about the mindset that he was coming from from that great Barcelona team he played with two to City and you know you have to remember when he came this was really the beginning of our success that was the first FA Cup won back in 2011 and then and then the Premier League the following year and he told me that the mindset they had in Barcelona was a mindset that you need to win every game Viera friendly be it any competition the mindset was we have to win every single game we play and they were you know the entire team entire organization all the players were programmed for that and we didn't have that mentality that we didn't have that mentality that the mindset we have today is treating every game as a game we have to we go in to try to win every game and play one game at a time and to try to win every competition we compete it that's that's the my turn and to do that of course you need to build squads improve squads change squads a little the same players probably won't be here next season nor absolutely last season how far advanced are plans for next season in terms of transfers advanced very advanced you know Chris we have a system now this this this club now is amateur club this organization is a mature organization we plan early we execute quickly and and I think relatively well there is no surprises the way we approached every pre-season is consistent we know our requirements early on we start you know our scouting very early we start you know the conversations between the football director the manager we start the budgeting process early by the time the season is over before the season is over we know exactly what we need and we've already started planning and we've already started the the necessary approaches that's actually one of the things we get credit for would not we'll come to it later but I did credit a lot of credit for an awful lot of things they cease but that is one thing everyone talks about is that city or an organized Club everything's in place from top to bottom everyone knows what they're doing any runs like clockwork and that's not an accident no it's not an excellent question it's not an accident you know it's it's no secret you you you see the correlation between good organization good planning good investment and results there's the direct correlation and if you look at particularly the last two years six trophies six door fees and in the last 24 months that's a result not of the last two years it's as a result of the previous four or five years to get to that point where you can do so I go back to that winning mentality that winning mindset the appreciation by everyone involved and what needs to be done and that hunger that is continuously there women this organization is not designed to be to sit down and just be content it's always about looking at the future it's always a lot about winning it's all about getting better you look at the list of all these players that we've that we've invested in brought in into the organization they came in as young players highly talented and had a value that maybe at the time was considered maybe high but as shown clearly over the last you know months and years that we've invested very wisely and that the value is appreciated significantly and in some cases quite significantly so I think we've invested well and I think you should expect the same you should expect the same because it's the same system it's the same people as the same organization and we'll keep doing that so that leads me to the profile of the silence the days of signing ready-made superstars age 28 29 30 they'd gone forever you'll see a consistency of what we've been doing over the last couple of years which is buying younger players with with a high potential we've done that and as you've seen also we've renewed the contracts of most of these players but you look at the you know Gabrielle who Zeus you look at Sonny you look at Edison you look at sterling you look at Bernardo silver in LaPorte I mean these players have not peaked we signed them we make sure they have long-term contracts with us we manage that contractual relationship I think extremely well and the timing of these renewals extremely well some of them we've renewed a year after signing on why because they've deserved it and I think that's very important in managing our people is they are fairly compensated to what they deserve within the marketplace now it doesn't mean just to answer your question that we wouldn't sign a 26 or 28 year old know if that is the need I mean if you look at what we did last year ringing in riyad mahrez I mean your matters fall into that category and yes we needed another talented experienced player in his peak or get it our approaching to speak and and that's what we needed and that's what we got so we will do that too but the strategy in general is more focused towards investing in the younger players so one of the other end of that spectrum Vincent Kompany who waved goodbye can you describe what he's meant to the club over the last ten and a bit years 11 years so with Vincent you know I have a very special place for Vincent and my my heart and relationships within this club because Vincent was I'll be the first player I interacted with when I first became chairman of this club Vincent had just been signed he was young but you can tell from they wanna do something special about about Vincent and he's been a giant to this club the word legend yeah I don't use it lightly but he's truly a legend what he's accomplished for us you know as a captain as a player as a leader as a leader both on and off the field Vincent is really you know mr. Manchester City and I think it's a massive loss there's no question about that there's some player is always in the history of any club that are irreplaceable and and Vincent is irreplaceable but time is time and and players reach a point in their career where they have to make a decision Vincent came to me after the Leicester City game and and I think in that moment he that's when he made up his mind that what he wanted to do was it was to end his career on a high we knew and he knew that the probability of finishing with with that trouble was gonna be it was gonna be high and in his mind he wanted to leave on top at the peak of his of his performance you know FinCEN sees himself certainly in his career going into coaching and I think having that opportunity to go back to his home team to coach on their left and to play as a player coach I think was a was a very unique opportunity and for that time so I think for him the stars kind of lined up and it made sense from a footballing sense I think he made absolutely the right decision and I told Vincent whatever you decide I'm behind you 100% and I need ultimately took that decision so so we will miss him we will miss him no doubt about that we will give him I think the right tribute his testimonial will be in an amazing event that I'm looking forward to and this club will respect Vincent in the way he deserves and and I'm confident the story of Manchester City and Vincent Kompany mmm it's far from over I was gonna end with that is it goodbye or over no no it's not goodbye it's certainly not goodbye the Vincent will be part of this is part of the family will be always be part of the family and and this journey continues and I have a feeling for sure the good feeling that we will be seen Vincent back here in some capacity at some point in the future something you you might not have a such a good feeling about despite the success this year we see still seem to be the center of a lot of negative commentary from in England and from around Europe every day there seems to be a new negative spin on something we've done seen yet a bus was talking about how gas money and oil money were driving up the the prices of footballers or distorting the market and how do you feel when you I mean it tires the the fan in Manchester an old it hires them well let me let me answer this in into into two parts in football I think people know what teves is about I think he sees himself or he plays the role of a politician so I think he plays to his constituency whatever that might be so he says what I think he wants to say and what Ryles his constituency but take him too seriously because people the others credibility what that comes with with people and I think he distorts facts you know he talks about what did he say that we were distorted the market or is another driving driving driving prices done I mean you know there's a there's a hypocrisy in this statement that is ironic well number one let's look at the Spanish league the time of breaking records on on player acquisitions I mean who started that let's let's go back to the real world records Figo Zidane I mean these huge jumps and these transfers I mean were these what they happen you know you have to look back at the history of La Liga it's a league that is dominated by two clubs and mr. Chavez should look back at history and how you know distortion has happened throughout the ages then you look back at the transfers I mean in the top-ten transfers of all time Manchester City has not a single player and that not a single one so I don't really take that seriously and I ask for our fans to always put it in context always look at facts and and I think people with with glass homes shouldn't be throwing rocks and let's let's always stick to facts I'm happy to talk to anyone as long as the conversation is about facts but once we start talking about any window and then talking about theories and I have no time for them and I mention of oil and gas in particular things that have another connotation you know I think there's something deeply wrong in bringing ethnicity into this into the conversation I mean this is this is just ugly I think the way he's combining teams just because of ethnicity I find that very very disturbing to be honest you know Chris I will not accept for this club to be used as a diversion tactic on poor investment decisions from other cops people make decisions they gotta live by them we've managed ourselves well and and we will be judged by facts and facts alone I mean this is a we're one well-run club I mean that's a fact it's a well-managed waste revenue ratio that compares to some of the best run clubs and in his league and La Liga but frankly in all of European football we've crossed the five hundred million pound revenue milestone who at this club our investments you look at all our investments in the last couple of years has been consistently outperforming in terms of players and in terms of performance on the pitch you look at the results again so I think that there's nothing for me to be ashamed of let's see it's the opposite let's let's go back into Toulon to Manchester ten years ago chef Mansour made a commitment to this club and to the city and you look at ten years on did he make that promise and did he fulfill that promise absolutely yes you just have to walk around in Manchester and ask the people of Manchester and by the way both sides on I've heard that from Manchester United fans a real appreciation to what what's been done in Manchester we've not taken money out of this game we've consistently reinvested in this game and grown this business is this bad for football it does appear that mr. Chavez has a special place for Manchester City in in most of his commentary well listen I don't think it's just an attack on on Manchester City I think there's there's a there's a there's a clear attack on the Premier League and that's been consistent coming from that way I mean let's not forget this is the best league in the world and if you look at this season there's no better testament to the statement where the two European competition the Champions League and the European Cup are being the finals are being competed by English teams ef4 Premier League teams competing in the two European finals that's a fact and that bothers a lot of people in many places and I find it very strange you know coming back here in the UK and in England is we have to be protecting that we have the best league in the world we have the most commercial league in the world we have the most successful clubs in the world economically commercially I think in terms of a global presence this is this is a special league and going back to mr. T bus that's why this attack is not just on Manchester City this attack is against this league and I hope people start seeing that and start I know people don't want to defend Manchester City but for God's sakes start defending this league nevertheless for each of the trophies we've won this year four of them we have investigations looking at the club how are they panning out and do you feel uncomfortable about any of them and more importantly how disappointing is it that it seems from the outside looking in that some Premier League teams have also been pushing for these either sanctions or or inquiry so am i uncomfortable no I think I respect regulatory bodies doing their job and any regulatory process that asks questions we have to I think professionally respond to which is what we've done we are dealing with each one of these entities as per the process we have clear answers I believe quite comfortably if the the process is going to be judged on facts then unquestionably we will prevail if it's not about facts and it's about other things then it's a different conversation but I certainly hope that a these regulatory bodies ultimately will make decisions based on facts now having said that just going back on you know this wave that we are we are dealing with I think listen it's it's you know I'll be philosophical about this we've dealt with this before I mean with UEFA this is not the first time we're going to go through the appropriate steps and we're confident in our position we're very comfortable in our position I'm not I'm not concerned about that because facts will prevail but having said that you know in in sports in general and and you know that Chris you know with success you know there's a certain level of you know jealousy and we called whatever that comes that's part of the game you know when you know when Manchester United dominated the Premier League for many years they know what they had to deal with for so many years that's part of the game it's not easy for our competition we know that you know by the way the football world is very small and what comes around very quickly so you know what someone somewhere in a leadership leading position in any club says something or brief something guess what we know about it but the reality we didn't buy the most expensive player in the Premier League wouldn't buy their most expensive goalkeeper we didn't buy the most expensive defender we didn't buy the most expensive midfielder we didn't buy the most expensive striker so when people throw that what you know they throw at us I go back let's look at facts look at the facts let's talk about facts,"The transcript features an interview with a chairman discussing a successful season for an English football club, highlighting its historic achievements and future plans. The conversation covers their triumph in English competitions, the challenges of winning the Premier League, and the team's strong internal organization. The chairman emphasizes their strategy of investing in young, high-potential players and praises key figures like Vincent Kompany for their contributions. The transcript also addresses external criticisms, particularly those related to accusations of financial market distortion and the use of Gulf money in football. The chairman refutes these claims, calling them hypocritical and factually inaccurate, noting that the club has not purchased the most expensive players. He criticizes conflating the club's investments with ethnicity and defends the club's operations as well-managed and fiscally responsible. Additionally, the chairman defends the English Premier League amid attacks, positioning it as the world's leading competition. While acknowledging ongoing investigations into the club, he expresses confidence in their adherence to regulations and dismisses the investigations as jealousy-driven backlash.",Sportswashing,-1,No,Manchester City ownership,UAE

according to chairman khaldoun al mubarak is to spread the city brand on a global stage we have an ambition as a football group to have an organisation that is global and that will have multiple clubs

badges are redesigned sometimes the name of the club is changed altogether as happened in 2014 when the group bought Melbourne Heart and controversially changed its name to Melbourne City FC business deals have followed connected to the Abu Dhabi royal family Manchester City famously signed a 10-year 400 million pound sponsorship deal with Etihad Airways the national carrier of the United Arab Emirates given the huge increase from any previous sponsorship deal and the fact that the company is effectively run by one of Sheikh Mansour laws relatives Sheikh Hamad bin Zayed l9 the deal caught the attention of UEFA who suspected that it didn't represent a fair market trade in the end he wafer approved the sponsorship deal but find the club a record 49 million pounds for its lavish spending those sponsorship deals have continued across the globe Etihad signed a shirt sponsorship deal with New York City FC and also appears to be on the front of the Melbourne City FC shirts a massive new kit deal was just signed with Puma which would apply to all CFG teams except New York City FC who are obliged to wear adidas due to a tie-up with MLS these globalized commercial deals alongside booming TV rights revenue and the shifting of some costly salaries from Citi onto its group has helped to make Manchester City profitable something that seemed impossible a few years ago given the 1 billion pounds plus spent on transfers since Sheikh Mansour bought the club from deposed Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra in 2008 last year city announced that they'd made a profit for a third year running of just over 1 million pounds in 2016-17 there was also record breaking revenue of close to four hundred and seventy three point four million pounds placing City in the financial elite of world football and yet not all is rosy with how CFG operates with its globalised stable of clubs raising issues about conflicts of interests and controversy surrounding the movement of players between teams within the group when Spain international David Vere signed for NYC FC he first went back to Melbourne City FC for a month to gain match sharpness before being shipped back to New York for the start of the season and then there was the issue of Frank Lampard signed to NYC FC to much fanfare instead he went on loan to Manchester City CFG later said that the NYC FC announcement had been a mistake but one that had far-reaching consequences the affair had shone a light on the city football group who were creating a network of clubs where players and staff might be interchangeable potentially circumventing local transfer rules and creating all sorts of potential conflicts of interest there had long been worries about owners taking control of multiple clubs but this was clearly a structure UEFA and other Gulf bodies weren't prepared for at the start of 2016 the issue came up again in relation to the signing of 23 year old Australian midfielder Anthony Casares city paid his club the Central Coast Mariners the 325,000 Australian dollars fee and promptly loaned him to Melbourne City FC the move incensed Melbourne city's rifles as cash transfers between clubs are banned in the a-league the head of Sydney FC tweeted that he believed Kassar Estus City is wrong how can the FFA allow this there are no transfers between a league clubs yet it seems you can bypass it left the Football Federation Australia scrambling to close the loophole before it happened again there is perhaps another issue other than clever financial tricks to keep city and its group of float and in

Dhabi United Group, focused on global football investments. CFG owns multiple clubs, including Manchester City, Melbourne City FC, and stakes in various other clubs worldwide. The group's strategy involves rebranding and aligning these clubs under a unified Manchester City identity, accompanied by significant sponsorship deals tied to Abu Dhabi's royal family. A contentious deal with Etihad Airways was scrutinized by UEFA but ultimately approved, although the club was fined for excessive spending. CFG's globalized business model has generated significant profits, with Manchester City reporting consecutive profitable years, defying previous expectations based on massive transfer expenditures.",Financial Ethics in Sports,-1,No,Manchester City ownership,UAE
1o7i2jrQiZY,Why Manchester City’s scandal is really about power,"- [Announcer] Just unbelievable. There's never been a final day like this. - I wanna show you what
I think could be some of the most important 90
seconds in football history. It's the final minutes of the final day of the 2012 English Premier League season. The score's tied, but this
team, Manchester City, really needs a goal. - [Announcer] Manchester
City could go and score here and win the league with
just about the last pick of the season. - [Narrator] But there wasn't much time. - [Announcer] And there
are two minutes to play. - [Narrator] A Manchester City player finds striker Sergio Aguero,
who pushes up field, passes, and makes a desperate dash to the goal. - [Announcer] Aguero! Staggering! Just staggering! He's won the league with
90 seconds of stoppage time to play! - This is the moment City won its first championship in 44 years,
but more importantly, it's the moment City
began to change football. This club would go on to
win every trophy available, assemble the most
expensive squads ever seen, and create a new kind of organization that spans the globe in all
a little more than a decade. Love them or hate them, Manchester City deserves a lot of credit for achieving what few, if any, clubs have done before,
unless it was cheating. - Manchester City, who've been charged by the Premier League. - With more than 100 counts
of violating finance rules. - [Reporter] During every
one of the 14 full seasons. - [Reporter 2] If found guilty, the sanction could be unprecedented. - It's the world's most popular league versus the world's most dominant club. And I'm gonna show you what
Manchester City is accused of, how a bunch of hacked emails
could be the smoking gun, and how the consequences
go far beyond the sport. - And we know that the UK
government's worried about this. The embassies are asking,
how's the case going? The stakes are incredibly high. (intense electronic drum music) - [Narrator] It's pretty unlikely that Manchester City is
even in this situation. Sure, back in the 1960s, it won three major
trophies in three years. - [Announcer] And then
again is Manchester City are the champions of the first division! - [Narrator] But then it spent
the next 40 years losing. - [Announcer] Oh. Oh, has he given the goal? He has! My word! Oh, look at that. - [Narrator] Manchester City wasn't even the best team in the city of Manchester, but 2007, it was in a bad spot. Billionaires were taking
over a few top clubs, like Manchester United,
Liverpool, and Chelsea, and City was among the rest falling behind until someone suddenly bought it, someone far richer than
all these other owners. Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al
Nahyan is a senior member of the royal family of Abu Dhabi. That's the wealthiest
state in the oil-rich United Arab Emirates. Now, he might tell you that
his country loves football and that buying a Premier
League club was a smart way to gain influence in the sport. And he wouldn't be wrong, but... - Someone else might suggest
it's about sports washing. - [Narrator] Matt Slater's
been covering football for more than 20 years. - UAE, you know, they have
human rights challenges, and maybe by investing in sport, you know, you can get people to sort
of see you differently. They're trying to diversify
their economy away from oil and gas. They're trying to give something for their people to feel proud about. But I think all of those
things have played a part. - [Narrator] But everything depended on getting City to start winning. So on his first day as owner, Mansour began buying what
it needed most: new players. City spent a staggering 43
million euros to sign Robinho, a star Brazilian who reportedly
thought he had signed with Manchester United. (record scratching) In that season, it spent
nearly 200 million pounds on players and finished in 10th. The next year, it spent
more and improved to fifth. Then after even more
spending, it rose to third, and won England's domestic tournament. In 2012, City won the title, sealed by a spectacular goal by their new forward, Sergio Aguero. - [Announcer] Aguero! - [Narrator] It had only taken four years and an unprecedented spending spree. - It was really sort of like this sort of compounding effect. It was 200 million, 300
million, 300 million. Chelsea had done something very similar, but it was like this is a transformation within three windows within 18 months. - But if this football club was going to help Abu Dhabi project power and gain influence, it
had to keep winning. So Mansour kept spending. His club routinely set records to sign the most sought after players and outbid the other clubs. In 2021, City assembled the first squad to cost more than a billion pounds. And after 16 years, City had spent more than
any club in the world, and it was worth it. City won seven more Premier
League titles, six EFL Cups, three FA Cups, and in 2023,
it won the Premier League, the FA Cup, and the
European Champions League. - [Announcer] The best team in Europe! Maybe the best team of all time! - [Narrator] Mansour had
turned a mediocre club into the best in the world, but many had trouble believing
he did it all legally. - So we've always had a sort
of tolerance with big clubs being big and spending
more than the others. I think the thing that people
were perhaps a little bit suspicious by was we
were just entering this era of financial fair play. - Financial fair play are rules that European Football
and the Premier League introduced at the start of the 2010s to prevent clubs from
spending their way to victory. They are what the Premier League is now accusing Manchester
City of violating, and it claims to have emails to prove it. Hacked emails are at the
center of this story, and if it can happen to the
biggest football club in the world, it can probably happen to you too. I mean, just last week,
I got notifications that like someone from Idaho
tried to get into my Netflix and someone in South Carolina
tried to get into my Gmail. It reminded me about how

for supporting our work, and I'll take you back to the episode. So European and English football leagues introduced financial fair play rules in order to try and stop a crisis. Many club owners were going bankrupt trying to get their club to win while other owners enjoyed an advantage because they were so rich
they could never go bankrupt. For example, those that
ruled over a whole country. (crowd singing) So boil down to its most basic premise, FFP rules state that a club cannot spend more money than it makes. So, since Manchester City
spent a ton of money, it would've needed to
also make a ton of money to stay within the rules. If I add its revenue to this chart, we can see that, in fact, it did. It spent recklessly on
players after the takeover, but a sudden surge of revenue
around 2013 allowed it to stay within the rules. It checks out on the surface, but it's this surge that
many find suspicious. How did Manchester City make
so much money so quickly? Its revenue comes from three sources, but ticket sales were consistent and TV profits grew gradually. That leaves sponsorships,
which grew unusually fast. After Mansour took over, a few companies began paying
City abnormally high prices to have their logos on its
shirts, signs and stadium. Their money is largely what boosted City's revenue high enough to let it legally buy so many new players. I should also mention that
these companies all had one big thing in common. - You don't have to be a forensic
account to see, oh, right, so Sheikh Mansour and his
family are on the board of that, and that, and that, and Mubadala, which is UAE's big sovereign wealth fund. Oh, they invest in that. Oh, how interesting. So Etihad Airlines, right. Oh, where are they based? Abu Dhabi. That is where the suspicion
starts immediately. One, you're spending loads of money, and you're justifying it in this new financial fair play era by
these amazing sponsorship deals. Come on. - [Narrator] In 2014, Europe's football governing
body did investigate City's sponsorship deals and found it had violated FFP rules, but only fined it 49 million pounds. Suspicion continued until this guy finally found some hard evidence. - I'm a whistleblower. I have to expose and give to journalists, credible journalists, the real deal. - [Narrator] In 2015, this
hacker began publishing thousands of confidential documents and emails he had stolen
from European football clubs and gave them to journalists to look through, like Christophe. - My name is Christophe Winterbach, worked on the Football
League's project, Der Spiegel. - [Narrator] In 2018, he and his team published a series of articles based on emails
they found from Manchester City employees, confirming that, yes, it was in danger of violating FFP. - They were very open about
that in their internal emails and they were desperate to find a scheme to make it seem like they were
passing those regulations. - [Narrator] What they found
worked something like this. In order to make room for alt spending, the club began charging
companies inflated prices to sponsor them, but only
had them pay some of it. Abu Dhabi's Sovereign Wealth
Fund, led by Sheikh Mansour, would provide the rest, so that when the companies would pay City, the club could count it as revenue, giving it more room to spend on players. - So they set up vehicles for hidden cash injections
from Abu Dhabi into the club, and sometimes even it's the
same people actually making decisions in the club and in the company who's paying the club. - [Narrator] Like in this
email where City employees list the funds the club expects from sponsors and what should come from
the Sovereign Wealth Fund. Christophe's got more. - Yeah, hold on, I've got a document here. They said things like, ""As we discussed, the annual obligation of this company, of this state-owned sponsor
is 3 million pounds. So the remaining 12 million
will come from alternative sources provided by His Highness."" - Sounds like there's evidence of them covering up the scheme as well. - They had to sometimes
reassure themselves. They were like, they should go through the companies to us, to the club. Yeah, like ideally, we
should do it that way. - [Narrator] In this email, City's chief financial officer asked permission to alter a series
of sponsorship contracts to which a club director replies, ""Of course, we can do what we want."" - Again, that is not a normal behavior. - [Narrator] If true, this
scheme would've allowed City to spend far more than other clubs, afford more star players, and ultimately win all these trophies. So if it's true, it means
that City was cheating. - They have played beautiful football, but there's always an
asterisk to those successes because it would've taken years and maybe decades for Manchester City to like reach the same level by like behaving like a normal club. - This really would be a
conspiracy to cheat over a decade where they've been enormously successful. They've been very clever,
no one should dispute that, but the debate is, did they
cheat at the beginning? - [Narrator] City has always
denied any wrongdoing. In 2020, UFA used these emails to ban it from Europe's biggest
tournament for two seasons. But City appealed and argued
that the emails weren't proof and had the president of a sponsor say the conspiracy didn't happen, convincing the court to lift the ban. Now it's the Premier League's turn to try. In 2023, it charged City with
more than 130 rule violations covering this whole time period. They include failure to provide
accurate information about sponsorships and for obstructing
their investigations. - It comes at a time when, of course, the Premier League is the most successful domestic soccer competition. Clubs like Manchester City
have helped tell that story. We are absolutely in
can of worms territory. - Right now, it's mid-January. So Manchester City and the Premier League have
been arguing their cases to a panel of three judges
behind closed doors. Now these judges are likely
to find Manchester City guilty of obstructing justice and
giving them a fine for it. The real question is whether
they find them guilty of this scheme, and if they do, what should the punishment be? Now the lightest punishment will likely be deducting points from them. That was the punishment for
two other clubs recently found guilty of violating FFP. But City is accused of
doing far more than them, leading some to wonder
whether they could be expelled from the Premier League. This would be one of the most
serious punishments in the league's history and dozens of clubs that City beat could
sue it for compensation. On the other hand, the light
punishment could lead clubs, like those owned by sovereign wealth funds and private equity groups, to start disregarding the rules too. - You know, if they can sort
of say, well, do you know what? It's almost like a luxury tax. Let's effectively cheat
because they're so bruised, I don't even know if the
Premier League gonna take us on because they've spent a fortune fighting that Manchester City case. Have they got the stomach and
the appetite to do it again? I think it becomes really hard for certainly the Premier
League to force this rule book if they lose everything. - For the Premier League,
credibility is at stake. - [Narrator] There are
geopolitical stakes, too. Over the past decade, Abu Dhabi
has purchased more football clubs to create a global network
called a multi-club model. These clubs support and
feed each other while giving Abu Dhabi influence in strategic
places all over the world, and it's revolutionized the sport. But if its crown jewel is expelled, the whole thing's at risk. Through City, the UAE has
also become a crucial source of investment for the city
of Manchester and the UK. That's probably why the British and Emirati governments have
been discussing the case. - United Arab Emirates
is a long-term ally, an important economic partner of the UK. So there is the huge potential
for embarrassment here. Yeah, there's a lot at stake here and there really is nothing like it. - [Announcer] Aguero! Staggering! Just staggering! - In the most entertaining way possible, Manchester City changed football. But the question now is whether
it was a miracle or a lie. All right, thanks so much for watching. If you haven't subscribed to Search Party, we cover sports and geopolitics. I'm gonna keep an eye on
this Manchester City story. We're expecting a decision
kind of any month now, so I'll update you all, probably community post or maybe even make a short
when that decision comes down. We've got a lot more episodes on the way. A story Japan, a story from Syria, a special project that I'm
excited to tell you all about. So it's gonna be a good couple months. If you've got recommendations, if you've got stories

It begins by recounting the dramatic final victory in the 2012 English Premier League, which marked the start of the club's transformation. The transformation involved enormous financial investments, primarily through acquiring top players, resulting in the club's unprecedented success in various competitions over a decade. However, this success is marred by accusations of financial rule-breaking. Manchester City faces over 100 charges by the Premier League for allegedly breaching financial fair play (FFP) rules. The accusations are backed by leaked emails that suggest the club inflated sponsorship deals with companies linked to Abu Dhabi's ruling family and sovereign wealth fund to circumvent spending limits. Despite being previously fined for such breaches by UEFA, City continues to deny wrongdoing. The case has both sports and geopolitical implications, as not only does it threaten Manchester City's achievements and the integrity of the Premier League, but it also involves the broader influence Abu Dhabi has been garnering globally through a multi-club ownership model. The unfolding case could have major repercussions, including potential sanctions against the club, which some argue might range from point deductions to league expulsion, thus putting at risk the broader network and investments associated with Abu Dhabi. The transcript also lightly touches on sponsorship information from Incogni, which pulls away from the main narrative about the Manchester City case.",Sportswashing,-1,No,Manchester City ownership,UAE

Uruguay Australia Spain and beyond all under the city football group umbrella and it was all thanks to an unlimited supply of money yes but also to the prudence and strategic forward-thinking of the owners from the United Arab Emirates right canny businesspeople who turned the biggest loss in football history 197 million in a single season into a 10 million pound profit last season the third season in a row that the club was in the black in 2015 13 percent of the club was sold to Chinese investors for 400 million dollars valuing the club at today's exchange rate at 2.4 billion pounds although it would likely sell for more if the club was put on the market today much of this financial turnaround was thanks to booming television and commercial revenue with the latter proving particularly lucrative huge sponsorship deals were signed with Etihad Airways the mobile phone network Etisalat Abu Dhabi's tourism authority and Abu Dhabi investment firm a bar all of course came from the United Arab Emirates where Sheikh Mansour is the country's Deputy Prime Minister and one of the UAE s most powerful men the companies were often run or owned by members of his own family that always been question marks over the true value of those contracts and suggestions that they had been artificially inflated to comply with UAFS Financial Fair Play rules which were designed to curb just such prolific spending from the bottomless pockets of sheiks and oligarchs or as the then UEFA president Michel Platini called it financial doping those accusations were dismissed by the club UEFA did conclude that city had inflated the market rate for its sponsorship deals but only received a slap on their wrists more on that later but at the start of November a very different story began to emerge thanks to football leaks a mysterious organization that has released sensitive documents exposing the dark underbelly of football this batch of internal documents leaked to the German publication der Spiegel and shared with European investigative collaborations appeared to show how Manchester City's ownership had allegedly gone to extraordinary lengths to circumvent UEFA rules to pump huge amounts of cash into the club much of it officially off the books so that it appeared to comply with FFP in one leaked internal document dated a few days before Sergio agüero famous injury-time goal against QPR clinched Manchester City its first Premier League title in 2012 the total cash investments in MCFC by Sheikh Mansour since his takeover stood at 1.1 billion pounds big spending to win the title was nothing new of course Jack Walker a self-made steel magnate famously bankrolled Blackburn Rovers his boyhood club to the Premier League title in 1995 but this was a different era one where financial Fairplay was the order of the day FFP was UA firs attempt to rein in the debt that was threatening to sink European clubs whilst also preventing billionaires from simply buying titles but rather than comply the Football League's revelations show that Manchester City was hell-bent on spending the money they needed to catch up with Europe's elite anyway and allegedly devising a secret project to hide over 100 million pounds worth of investment according to the leaked communications from within Manchester City the club was massively inflating its sponsorship contracts to hide cash injections from the owner which would be a clear breach of FFP one such email reported by des Spiegel appears to show how city's chief financial officer Jorge chimere's outlined how the sacking of Roberto Mancini left the club with a 10 million pounds liability we will have a shortfall of nine point nine million pounds in order to comply with UEFA ffp this season he wrote this deficit is due to Roberto Mann Chinese termination I think that the only solution left would be an additional amount of AD Abu Dhabi sponsorship revenues that covers this gap which is exactly what they did Simon Pearce and Australian PR executive who sits on city's board and who is in charge of massaging Abu Dhabi's international image and reputation suggested back dating sponsorship contracts including a fee for winning the FA Cup when chimere's asked Pierce if this was possible piss replied of course we can do what we want most damningly the emails appear to show that other contracts were in effect sham deals funded by the Abu Dhabi royal family take the 15 million pound sponsorship deal with a bar it was in fact only three million pounds from the company and the rest from the family as we discovered the annual direct obligation for a bar is 3 million pounds Thais allegedly wrote in one email the remaining 12 million requirement will come from alternative sources provided by his highness this was in effect an attempt to cook the books and pull the wool over you Ava's eyes disguising cash investments by His Highness to make Manchester City appear to be a more profitable organization than it was in total it appeared that the extra money hidden from view amounted to one hundred and twenty seven point five million pounds man there were other schemes too one dubbed Project longbow that involved setting up a shell company to buy the image rights of players from the club which opened up what looked like another stream of income in effect the money allegedly came from Abu Dhabi even Roberto Mann Chinese contract appeared to be part paid by a football club in the UAE man Cheney was also contracted to advise Al Jazeera and Abu Dhabi Club owned by Sheikh Mansour which isn't part of the city football group it was another attempt to get more money on city's books but this still wasn't enough when FFP was rolled out for the 13/14 season nuevas investigators zeroed in on what looked like artificially inflated sponsorship contracts through clubs in particular concerned UEFA Manchester City and PSG effectively owned by the state of Qatar PSG had signed a five-year 190 million pound a year contract with the Qatar Tourism Authority the value of the contract was close to 1 billion pounds UEFA decided that the true value of the contract was just under 2.5 million pounds a year the same discrepancies were found at City but rather than accept censure which would have included a huge fine and a band from the Champions League according to the leaks city threatened UEFA with legal action that could bankrupt it the clubs lawyer Simon Cliff allegedly wrote in an email that city's chairman Khaldoun said he would rather spend 30 on the best 50 lawyers in the world to sue them for the next 10 years UEFA would have to decide whether to proceed as planned or avoid the destruction of their rules and organization the football leaks trove of emails showed that Gianni Infantino who is then the general secretary of UEFA bent over backwards to accommodate city and PSG for the breaches of FFP that they were found guilty of in the end both City and PSG accepted small fines and a mild slap on the wrists and city's internal team declared it mission accomplished so what's next UEFA snoo president has announced that they must go back and look at city MPs G's cases but there are doubts about whether they can be punished given that both clubs have already accepted censor and will UEFA really wants to take on the bottomless pit of money that the royal families of Qatar and the UAE could use to destroy it but the revelations have done one thing until recently the ownership of Manchester City was seen as a benign good news story that burnished Abu Dhabi's reputation the recent revelations about human rights abuses in the country and the appalling loss of life and levels of child starvation in the war in Yemen a conflict the UAE is heavily involved in has tarnished the country's reputation key figures City like Mubarak and Sheikh Mansour are involved in the highest level of economic and political decision-making in the UAE separating the team from the political and military actions of the country has become harder in the wake of the Football League's revelations Amnesty International declared that the UAE s enormous investment in Manchester City is one of football's most brazen attempts to sports wash a country's deeply tarnished image through the clamor of the game city have said very little about the revelations although they haven't denied the probity of the documents instead they've said that the leaks were an organized and clear attempt to damage the club's reputation the club and city fans have long argued that FFP is in any case an unfair restraint on fair trade why should Nona be restricted from investing their own money in their own club a case could be made that FFP in fact entrances the dominance of the bigger clubs and prevents new players like city and PSG from breaking the cartel but both clubs knew the rules and signed up to them if you afer decide not to investigate city and PSG s alleged financial transgressions then none of these revelations will matter and it's hard to imagine any revelations that money and political power will win like it always

Dvh2M8lONLk,Why PSG's owners want to invest in a Premier League club,foreign but we are going to start with the potential news that Qatar sporting Investment Group could be looking to invest in a Premier League club now Tottenham has been mentioned at length in the past few days our chief reporter Carly solical is here to shed some light on this so Carvey um why I think is my first question why do the qataris want to invest in the Premier League well they want to invest in the Premier League because they want to build on the success of the World Cup they believe that the World Cup they hosted in November and December was the most successful World Cup ever and they want to build on the success of the World Cup now they already own PSG they own uh 23 stake in the Portuguese club Braga as well but they want to own more clubs and we've been told that 2023 is going to be a year of ambitious strategic Acquisitions for the qataris as far as football is concerned have they have any meetings yet well what is interesting I think you're talking about a story that we reported on Sunday night about the fact that the president of uh PSG who also runs Qatar Sports Investments uh had had a meeting with Daniel Levy the executive chairman of Tottenham Hotspur now in our story I think we were careful to say that the meeting wasn't necessarily about the qataris investing in Spurs Daniel Levy and NASA alkalafi meet each other regularly because they're both involved in the European Club association NASA alkalafi is the chairman and since 2021 Daniel Levy has been a member an executive board member of the European Club association so it is not out of the ordinary for them to meet each other as far as Tottenham are concerned the meetings between the two men were not about the qataris investing in Spurs it was not about the qataris acquiring a stake in Spurs but what we do know is that Qatari is a very very interested in investing in a Premier League club and at the moment uh quite unusually some of the biggest available aren't there clubs they're not necessarily available for sale but they're certainly available for you to invest in if you have the money to be able to do so yeah that would be Manchester United and Liverpool I guess you're talking about so is this an option do you think for the qataris yes um I think it's potentially an option why not uh the qataris uh when they bought PSG you have to bear in mind they bought PSG I think uh 12 years ago it was only for about 70 or 80 million pounds it is now worth something between three and four billion pounds yeah it's remarkable it's a remarkable return they are looking for Investments I think it would be complicated for them to buy Manchester United or Liverpool or even Spurs outright because it's difficult to own two major clubs you know they're going to come across each other in the Champions League complete conflict of interest surely so how does how would it possibly work even if they had a small stake well they wouldn't have to own the clubs another club outright they could invest and have a minority stake in another club the other thing that I would say is when it comes to Qatar Never Say Never people thought it would be impossible for Qatar to win the rights to host the World Cup people thought it would be impossible to host a World Cup in Qatar people said you couldn't have it in the summer it had to be in the summer they moved it to the winter I think there would be ways around it if that is what they wanted to do but I can't talk about specific clubs that they're interested in signing but they do want to invest in a Premier League club as well as buying other clubs and investing in other clubs around the world especially America and you have to look at the model that match the city's owners have set up people sometimes forget the owners of Manchester City don't just own Manchester City it is owned by the city football group and I think they own clubs in 11 different countries so I think the qataris want to replicate what the owners of Manchester City have done and they want to build on the success of the World Cup as they see it yeah I was talking about this yesterday satellite and horizontal ownership and things like that we won't go into that now but my final question to you Carvey then is this is is this good news for the Premier League it would be controversial uh you know the World Cup in Qatar was very very controversial everybody knows about the issues to do with migrant workers equality diversity in Qatar but we've seen for instance the Saudi Arabia government's investment fund by a big big stake in Newcastle United Okay that was controversial but that was allowed to happen I think the qataris would be able to buy a stake in a Premier League club I don't think there would be problems as far as the Premier League are concerned I think it would be allowed it would be controversial but I think you would have to speak to the fans of the clubs they're investing in I think in the Modern Age fans would welcome them with open arms because they would look at what they've done at PSG you've got players like Neymar Messi and Bape the biggest wage built in World football and I imagine if you're a Liverpool fan or if you're Manchester United fan or if you're a fan of any other club that psg's owners would invest in I think I'm not sure you'd work on them with open arms it depends you can't you can't talk generally about all football fans I think a lot of football fans would welcome them with open arms and a lot of football fans would have concerns about the issues that were highlighted during the World Cup in Qatar okay Calvary thank you very much [Music],"The transcript discusses the potential interest of Qatar Sports Investments in acquiring a stake in a Premier League football club, following the perceived success of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. The transcript highlights that Qatar Sports Investments, which owns Paris Saint-Germain and a portion of the Portuguese club Braga, is exploring investment opportunities as part of an ambitious acquisition strategy for 2023. A specific meeting between Qatar's investment head and Tottenham Hotspur's chairman is mentioned, but it is clarified that no concrete investment discussions took place. The transcript speculates that Qatari interest may extend to clubs like Manchester United or Liverpool but acknowledges the complexity of owning multiple major clubs due to conflicts of interest, especially in competitions like the UEFA Champions League. The conversation touches on the media's view of Qatar’s World Cup as controversial, citing issues such as migrant workers' rights, equality, and diversity. Nonetheless, the transcription suggests that many fans might welcome such investments, inspired by the transformation seen at PSG, while others might remain concerned about the ethical implications and controversies elicited during the World Cup in Qatar.",Sportswashing,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar

224pbl296dI,How The Qataris Have Got Everything Wrong At PSG,football is a team sport but the World Cup Final in Qatar two months ago between France and Argentina was very much billed as the Battle of two players on one side there was Lionel Messi already the greatest player of all time at a lot of people's eyes competing in his last World Cup having already won everything in the club game including the champions league and the Ballon d'Or by the age of 22 the World Cup was the one trophy but the biggest trophy of them all that had a looted Messi age 35 he had 90 minutes to change that and cement his status in most people's minds as the greatest to have ever played their game on the other side there was Kelly and mbappe age 23 and Bape was already competing in his second World Cup final having won the first one in Russia four and a half years ago a generational Talent the star of the tournament up to that point and the man that most people expect to inherit the mantle of being the best player on the planet during the post messy and Ronaldo era and that they had the chance to win his second World Cup before turning 24 following in the footsteps of the late great Palais neither player would disappoint Messi scored the opening goal and played a key role in the second as Argentina dominated the opening 75 minutes but then came the mbappe inspired France Onslaught in just two minutes and Bape scored two goals one from the penalty spot just like Messi and the other an outrageous volley which left the world speechless deep into extra time Messi scored again it looked to have been written in the stars the world's greatest player scoring at their death in his last chance to Crown his country as world champions and Bape would seem hadn't read the script just two minutes from time he dispatched his second penalty of the match it's a complete only the second hat-trick in a World Cup final and today take the game to penalties Argentina won the match both Messi and mbappe converting the opening penalties in the shootouts but both players emerge with their already sky-high reputations even further enhanced being no doubt this was the greatest player of all time and the greatest of the subsequent generation the idea that they should play for the same team at Club level therefore as even some Americans with only a very fleeting interest in the sports observed seemed to be downright unfair throw in the best player for the pre-tournament favorites Brazil the star of a Morocco team that reached the semi-finals a goalkeeper caps 50 times by the reigning European Champions at the age of 23 and the most decorated center-back ever to have played the game surely the team that has all of these players must be some kind of all-conquering Juggernaut that has made European football their own well not quite despite having the backing of the same Petro state that hosted the 2022 World Cup since 2011 PSG are yet to win their Champions League knocked out in the round of 16 last season the parisians just lost in the first leg at the same stage against Bayern Munich this season fresh off the back of a defeat to Marseille in the round of 16 of the coup de France PSG have now lost three games in a row for the first time since the qataris arrived in 2011 they have already lost more games in 2023 in February than they did in the whole of 2022 and real questions are starting to be asked of how it has come to this for a team which has the odds so firmly stacked in their favor so 15 months on from my last video about PSG entitled have PSG created a monster they can't control which has aged considerably better than most of the drivel that comes out of my mouth on this channel I wanted to return to the French capital and specifically to the partner prompts to ask the question of whether PSG are the stupidest Club in all of world football how they could have done things differently and why If Only They had hired me as their director of football they'd probably be bigger than Real Madrid by now all of which seems particularly relevant at this moment in time as the Qatari state is in talks to take over at Manchester United as well the Emir of Qatar acquired PSG through the investment vehicle Qatar Sports investments in June of 2011 and then became the club's Soul owner in March 2012. he and the dictatorship that he rules over inadvertently struck gold PSG have occupied a pretty much unique position over the last decade as the Seoul super Club in a region which has become the greatest Talent Factory in all of world football the Elder France region which surrounds and includes France's Capital has given rise to an extraordinary number of footballers during that time frame key members of France's 2018 World Cup winning Squad such as Killian and Bape Paul Pogba and Angolo kante were all born in paris's relatively impoverished suburbs or banliers as they are commonly known in France which have large first second and third generation immigrant populations and bape's father is from Cameroon whilst his mother isab Algerian kabile descent pogba's parents are both from Guinea and kante's parents hail from Mali all four of those countries you may have noticed a former French colonies other examples include Joel kunde Riyad mahrez Christopher and cuckoo furl and Mendy ibrahima canate William Saliba Adrian rabio and Seiko fafana in recent years paris's Banias haven't just been more productive than other regions and cities renowned for producing great players such as London Sao Paulo and Madrid they have outperformed almost every entire country on the planet what's more whilst London is home to six Premier League clubs including Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal Corinthians Palmeras and Sao Paulo are all fighting to secure the best players from the city of Sao Paulo and you can throw sansos into the mix from the state as a whole it has three La Liga teams including two European Giants in real and Atletico Madrid there isn't a single Top Flight football club from the entire IL de France region which is home to over 12 million people let alone from the city of Paris other than PSG in other words PSG ought to have an effective Monopoly over the greatest Talent Factory on planet's Earth yet they have failed miserably to capitalize upon that gift from the heavens of all of the players that I just mentioned who were born with an a stone's throw of the partner prompts only Killian and Bape plays for PSG and they paid 163 million pounds for him the second highest transfer fee of all time he didn't come through their own youth ranks and the only ones who did actually come through and then graduate from their youth ranks namely Adrian rabio and Christopher and cuckoo were sold for nothing in rabio's case and just 13 million euros in uncle use this is what I like to call the Komen conundrum yes I just invented it now no doubt everyone will be talking about it soon I will also accept the common contradiction as a viable alternative but I really do think that the Coleman conundrum is a better fit on the balance of things Kingsley Coleman was born not actually in one of paris's many bandliers but in the city itself so parents from Guadalupe Coleman joined the youth ranks of Sanam moisse at the age of six who competes in the regional and holy amateur 60 of French football following two years there the youngster was spotted and signed by PSG a Starman for France from the under-16s all the way through to the under-20 ones and among the most highly regarded youngsters in Europe and his teenage years Coleman became psg's youngest ever player at the age of only 16. by 17 however he had decided that his future lay away from the club having made just four first-team appearances in his own words Coleman said that he felt Juventus suited him more that he would make more first-team appearances there and that he had doubts about the capabilities of some of the senior figures at PSG PSG didn't receive a penny when Coleman departed as he signed for Juventus on a free transfer after his contract had expired and a year later he joined Bayern Munich on loan and then on a permanent in a deal which pocketed uvae a combine 28 million euros since leaving PSG Coleman has won the league in every single season of his career taking him up to a tally of eight top lightly titles at the age of 26. he has reached two Champions League finals with two different clubs and he won the second one in 2020. the Champions League final at Coleman won with Bayern Munich in 2020 came against PSG and it was fitting that he should score the only goal of the match in what was a close encounter tiranai his Boyhood Club of their Holy Grail Coleman once again scored the only goal of the game as Bayern beat PSG on Tuesday night to take a Wonder lead with them to the second leg back home in Munich Coleman is almost too perfect of an illustration of what the qataris have got wrong at PSG by buying a club in Lee gun which is the weakest of Europe's Big Five leagues and pumping it with as much if not more cash than any of the continent super clubs PS G we're always going to become flat track bullies at home psg's budget is literally five times that of the next highest spending league on side which means that winning the league untitle or the Coupe de France is barely considered an achievements it's more of a foregone conclusion the Champions League was always likely to become the de facto Mark of success at PSG then but PSG actually made it the official one Club president Nasser al-kalafi stated publicly as early as 2014 that the Champions League was psg's be all and end-all and that failure to win it in the next four years would constitute failure that was nine years ago now and by measuring themselves solely by their fate in a knockout competition every season he put PSG on her Harding to nothing it's quite difficult to win the Champions League I'm not sure if Al khalafi a former tennis player who achieved a career high of 900 and 95 in the world rankings was aware of that at the time and even if PSG were a well-runned football club which they most assuredly are not that would still be the case and at this point 12 years into the project even if PSG did win the Champions League there would be no lack of football fans who would shrug their shoulders point to their spending and say only one in 12 15 or 20 years depending on when if ever that moment finally arrives as much as the failures of strategy and general mismanagement that is what PSG have got so badly wrong no one likes them including their own Ultras and supporters quite a lot of the time who have voiced their displeasure at how the club is being run and when you're in the business of sports washing that is somewhat problematic after all we can't lose sight of what PSG and a handful of other football clubs have become this is not a fan-owned community Unity Club which is what PSG was founded as owned by 20 000 members nor is it The Preserve of a handful of wealthy parisians who wanted to see their team succeed which is what succeeded the club's fan own days this isn't even a club owned by an investment firm as PSG were in the form of colony Capital up to 2011. seeking a return on their investment based upon sporting and Commercial performance no this is a club owned by a state they would deny that but they would be lying which has zero emotional attachment to the club and is totally dispassionate to its fate other than as a means for achieving its wider goals sometimes those goals align with the views and Ambitions of the team supporters as has been the case up to this point broadly speaking at Manchester City or Newcastle United but there are times inevitably when those two things don't align that's not to say that the Qatari State doesn't want PSG to win the champions league for example of course they do just that they want it for very different reasons to PSG fans and it is not their primary goal what PSG is in the business of doing is giving the state of Qatar ever closer ties to the French government French politicians and French business people increasing qatar's influence and soft power within the region and cleansing the image of what is in fact a tiny authoritarian dictatorship in the Gulf that is why throughout their ownership the qataris have always been more focused on signing Superstars than they have been on building a great team you look at the likes of Beckham Buffon Danny Alves Neymar Messi and Sergio Ramos undoubtedly all great players but that isn't the main reason why any of them were signed Beckham was only at PSG for six months but he played his last ever game for the club creating iconic m images of him crying in a PSG shirts which were broadcast around the world and Qatar went on to further extend that relationship with Beckham by paying him 150 million pounds for a 10-year propaganda campaign Buffon stuck around for just a single season perhaps they were hoping he'd retire there too but the Italian is still somehow going strong at 45 now back up Palmer Alves similarly was only ever a short-term arrival mimal Neymar was signed as a statement of intent to send out a message to the rest of world football the PSG could effectively sign whomever they wanted by meeting a release Clause that Barcelona had set in the belief that no one would ever be stupid enough to pay such a ridiculous transfer fee I suspect that the upsides of signing Messi as they saw it go without saying it is perhaps telling that it was in 2011 shortly after Qatar won the right house the two thousand 22 World Cup that Qatar decided to take over PSG in November 2010 the Emir of Qatar then French president Nicolas Sarkozy and then UEFA president and France footballing Legend Michelle platini all had lunch together at the Elysee Palace shortly after that platini switched his vote for the 2022 World Cup hosts from the United States to Qatar Qatar subsequently not only bought PSG but also increased its ownership in a French Media Group acquired the broadcasting rights for all of French football and made a series of commercial deals with the French government which have continued ever since Sarkozy can still often be spotted sat alongside PSG president Nasser alkalafia PSG games and the current Emir of Qatar attended psg's defeats of Bayern Munich on Tuesday night but only because he was already in the French Capital to hold talks with now French president Emmanuel macron to discuss a further strengthening of the country's relations and future deals regarding the exports of natural gas it would be fair to say then that football wasn't the single most important part of the emir's trip platini claims that his meeting with Sarkozy and the Emir had nothing to do with him switching his votes and that he wasn't told to do so by Sarkozy stating quote Sarkozy never asked me to vote for Qatar but I knew what would be good end quote good for who exactly he didn't State though one can guess nor was it ever clarified at least as far as I can tell as to why platini just so happened to be having a spot of lunch at the Elysee palace with the French and Qatari heads of state Qatar of course denies any wrongdoing they do that a lot now that the World Cup is over there are those who wondered what kind of appetite Qatar would have to continue investing in PSG and whether they might alter their strategy moving forward in terms of image it's always going to be difficult to be cool and I use that word with a bit of a cringe or just to be liked when you dominate domestically every season by virtue of having a much larger budget than any of your Rivals the cool teams tend to be those who play good football don't always win and have an inferior budget to their Rivals whether that be Borussia Dortmund Napoli or Atalanta but some still do it better than others Barcelona iax and sway lesser extent Benfica for example all either are or were fairly well liked even whilst being relentlessly successful certainly domestically at least and having among the largest if not the largest wage bill in their respective divisions what those three all have in common are clear and very well-defined identities tied to the major European cities in which they are based and they fantastic track record of developing youngsters and locals and providing them with a pathway to the first team PSG as we have already established practically hold a monopoly as a football club over arguably the most iconic city in Europe if not in the entire world Paris is famous for being the city of love it has incredible history more iconic landmarks than just about any other place on earth a very distinct culture and identity and to top it all off an ability to churn out a plethora of outstanding footballers in essence the qataris had everything that they could ever have dreamed of handed to them on a plate of PSG but they chose to send it back and order a plate full of foie gras white truffle caviar A5 wagyu and those yubari melons that you get in Japan that can cost about 50 000 quid although very expensive Foods highly coveted and considered to be Delicacies but together they Clash there is just far too much going on making for a wretched dish and leaving you feeling rather nauseous by the end alright I am laboring the meta for just a little but you get the general idea PSG were once cool they had JJ kocha and Ronaldinho in the same team for Christ's sake along with a local Wonder kid in Nicholas and Alka sure they didn't win anything but they won the Champions League just as many times as the current crop with a big budget let alone an enormous one it would have been possible to build the best Academy in World football to nurture the finest crop of young players anywhere on the planet build a team of world-class locals from your own youth ranks with close ties to the club and complement them with just a sprinkling of galactico style signings for a bit of fun I had a go at doing just that here is a solely Elder France 11 and here is what the final product might look like with just three signings not from within the club's immediate vicinity not bad eh I have just saved PSG about a billion euros half that wage Bell made them slightly cool and liked again and a much better team if anyone from PSG is watching I do off the consulting services but I do not come cheap this is a point that I saw reiterated by Grace Robertson on Twitter the other night the same night that PSG lost to buy in about the lack of identity in local players and it's one that seems so obvious what is particularly unusual is the PSG have actually Incorporated the incredibly powerful brand of the City of Paris when it comes to their kits various fashion wear and other forms of branding they've just totally overlooked it on the pitch I suppose it's possible that that is being driven by Nike rather than PSG themselves but it is hard to believe that no one at the club could have spotted this contradiction I mean how many winning goals does Kingsley Coleman really have to score against them before the penny finally drops you'd rarely have thought that too one of them coming in a Champions League final would have been enough from the perspective of a Manchester United fan even if you are to ignore all of the ethical considerations purely from a footballing perspective are these really the people that you would want owning your Club a Petro state that struck gold in 2011 but has spent the last 12 years importing very expensive silver instead the difference at Manchester United being that they don't have a monopoly and there are no guaranteed titles in the Premier League now it would be remiss of me not to point out that there is some evidence that PSG have changed act over the last 12 months Leonardo psg's former sporting director who was criticized by fans was sacked in May 2022 Louis Campos officially appointed as a football advisor is his de facto replacement for the uninitiated Campos is widely regarded as one of the finest Talent spotters in World football and it was responsible for the recruitment which led to both Monaco and then Leal winning the league on title ahead of PSG through signings like James Rodriguez Bernardo Silva Nikola Pepe Raphael and Victor osserman now he is operating with a much larger budget the appointment of Christoph goltier who won the league on title at Lille can be viewed in a similar context as someone who is renowned for giving young players a chance and for having a clear idea of how he wants his teams to play up until now could anyone really pinpoint a style or philosophy that was distinct or unique to PSG whether that be under ancelotti tsukol or pochettino a persistent problem at PSG according to several sources at this stage has been the meddling of Club president Nasser al-kalafi and key to any future success at the very highest level will be football decisions being left to football people who gets to make those decisions however is that other contentious issue which only adds to the internal drama and politics which has plagued the club from boardroom to dressing room level Antero Herrero and Lewis Campos for example were said to have been a loggerheads during the summer transfer window and PSG ended up missing out on all four of their primary Targets in the forms of Milan skrinyar Robert Lewandowski Bernardo Silva and Marcus rashford in January the club missed out on another main target this time Hakim ziash though for rather different reasons in that case there is also evidence that PSG are finally starting to look to their Academy and the wealth of talent right on their doorstep Warren Zaire Emery at the age of 16 has already made 15 first-team appearances this season and became the youngest player in the history of the Champions League knockout stage when he started against Bayern Munich meanwhile 17 year old Elsa deal bit shy Boo has already registered 10 senior appearances they were born in 2005 and 2006 and should form the club's spine for the next decade and Beyond it also cannot be overlooked just in the interest of balance the PSG came very close to winning the Champions League in 2020 losing a 50 50 game in the final against a Bayern Munich team that had absolutely steamrolled their way through to the final smashing the likes of Barcelona Chelsea and Leon that doesn't change the fact that they didn't win that game though they don't have a clear sense of identity or style despite one being so readily available they have failed to capitalize on the Wellspring of local talents that they have been blessed with and the club is a toxic mess at this moment in time currently experiencing their worst run of form in more than a decade PSG are already out of the domestic cup competition a bit of low especially coming at the hands of their Fierce Rivals must say they face an uphill battle to get beyond the round of 16 in the Champions League for a second successive season heading to Munich with a one goal deficit and their next two League games are against high-flying Leo and Marseille they should win both but in their current form who knows psgr only five points ahead of Marseille in the league on table which means the next few games really could be make or break not since their first season under Qatari ownership in the 2011-12 campaign have PSG had a trophyllis season repeating that feat with a front three of Messi Neymar and mbappe a budget which is at least five times that of every other team in France and the highest wage bill in all of world football whilst improbable admittedly at this stage would be almost impressive in a weird sort of way and a damning indictment of the appalling way in which the club has been run the that

on both should you wish to do so,"The transcript provides an in-depth analysis of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) under Qatari ownership, focusing on the club’s management failures and its implications on both its sporting and geopolitical influence. The analysis begins by describing the high-profile World Cup final in Qatar between Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe, illustrating the high expectations placed on star players like those at PSG. Despite a significant investment and a unique opportunity due to the Ile-de-France region being a major talent hub, PSG has struggled to establish itself as a dominant force in European football. The transcript critiques PSG’s inability to capitalize on local talent and questions their focus on acquiring marquee signings which serve Qatari geopolitical interests more than the club’s success. It highlights instances of poor management decisions, such as signing big-name players for their brand value and the club's failure in the Champions League, which was set as the primary success indicator. It also provides insight into the political connections between Qatar and France, drawing attention to the softer power goals behind Qatar's investment in PSG, such as strengthening ties with French politics and business. The narrative critiques the underlying sportswashing elements, highlighting how the owners prioritize increasing Qatar’s influence and soft power, rather than focusing on building a sustainably successful football team. The potential Qatari interest in buying Manchester United is hinted, raising concerns about similar strategies being applied. Despite recent management changes, the transcript remains skeptical about PSG’s strategic direction and ownership motives, painting a picture of a club embroiled in internal conflicts and strategic misalignments.",Sportswashing,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar
aUpfkl_rWGs,EXACTLY HOW RICH IS PSG? | Explained,ever since psg beat the transfer record fee by signing namer for 222 million euros we all understood that psg were quite rich and the club has spent over 950 million dollars solely on transfers over the past six years so there is definitely some big bucks standing behind the club so today we'll be discussing exactly how rich is psg and if you're excited for this video make sure to smash a like and consider subscribing for more informative football videos and now let's get into it so this summer psg have already been able to sign three players sergio ramos ashraf hakimi and winaldo and they are extremely close to finalizing a deal with donnarama so it looks like they have no limit on how many players they can sign well until they hit the financial fair play limit however before they started signing so many players for so much money they were actually a club that was fan owned meaning that it had no real investors or budget but then things quickly changed when in 1973 psg was bought by two wealthy businessmen and after that a french premium television channel called canal plus took ownership of the club and 15 years later an american investment firm bought psg and lastly in 2011 the ruler of qatar al-thani became the owner of psg through state-owned shareholding organization qatar sports investments also known as qsi which actually means that psg is a two-state-owned club since both the ruler of qatar and the organization qatar sports investments own psg and the only other two state-owned club is manchester city and this organization and the ruler of qatar both made psg one of the richest clubs in the world with psg's owners having splashed out over 1 billion euros on players making them dominate in ligue 1 coup de france and more but it isn't as good as it seems because over the past decade psg has had two uefa investigations the first one was in 2012 when psg signed an agreement with qatar tourism authority also known as qta to promote qatar and in return the government of qatar agreed to pay over 1 billion euros over 5 years to psg which gave psg the ability to sign silva ibrahimovic and cavani as well as some others who were all very expensive signings and when ue found out about this deal they imposed numerous fines on psg but four years later uefa lifted the restrictions on psg and so psg renewed their partnership with the qatar tourism authority until 2019 which gave them the budget to sign neymar for 222 million euros and killian and bobby for 145 million euros but this time uefa just reduced the amount of money coming in from the qta after their second investigation of psg but this was still a lot of money but psg wanted more so psg found a new way to bring money to the club so they signed numerous deals with nike and air jordan with most of them active till this day and because of the financial growth supported by qatari owners and teams overall success on the pitch this made them bring in 541 million euros of revenue every year and giving them a 2.5 billion dollar valuation which is again why they can sign so many players and why it looks like they never have any financial issues nowadays so that is it for today's video make sure to subscribe for more informative football videos and make sure to let me know your thoughts on psg and their finances down in the comments below and if you found this video interesting make sure to drop a like and i'll see you in a bit,"The video transcript discusses the financial evolution of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) as a major football club. It highlights PSG's substantial investments in player acquisitions, particularly following Neymar's record transfer, emphasizing the club's financial backing. Initially fan-owned, PSG underwent a series of ownership changes, culminating in 2011 when Qatar Sports Investments (QSI), owned by the ruler of Qatar, took control. The club, now partly state-owned, has spent over 1 billion euros on player signings, solidifying its dominance in various football competitions. However, PSG's financial activities drew scrutiny, with UEFA conducting investigations in 2012 and later on regarding their dealings with the Qatar Tourism Authority (QTA). These deals provided significant funding for the club, leading to fines and restrictions later lifted or amended. Despite controversies, PSG's alliances with global brands like Nike and Air Jordan, facilitated by Qatari investments, have helped maintain the club's financial stability and brought in substantial annual revenue and overall valuation.

7TJrf1OtsJA,What's MISSING From The £2bn PSG Project?!│Explained,it's been almost 10 years since qatar sports investment turned french football on its head by gaining a controlling stake in paris saint-germain their objectives were clear turned psg not only into the biggest club in france but a brand recognized across the world their new president nasa spoke of a complete project that would evolve the club in its entirety and well over 1 billion euros later that vision is impossible to ignore critics warned psg could dominate for years to come and while the champions league still eludes them they've only failed to win ligand twice since the qatari money arrived but away from the pitch how successful has the psg project really been and a decade into their reincarnation what challenges de le perezian and al halaifi still face let's find out brand psg from the moment sheikh tamim bin hamad al-thani sanctioned the purchase an endless stream of stars has rocked up in the french capital they started by smashing the french transfer record with javier pastore and fast forward 10 years and 17 of the top 20 ligand transfers ever made feature arrivals at psg even then few could believe their eyes when in 2017 neymar arrived for a head-spinning 222 million euros more than double the previous world record before kylian mbappe returned to his hometown for a further 145 million euros the message was clear psg would not to be underestimated over 1 billion dollars has been spent on new players and countless more in wages it's an incredible sum that has attracted intense scrutiny not least from uefa's financial fair play question marks have been raised over the true value of their partnership with the qatar tourism board worth 215 million euros a year and the price paid for french champions league and domestic rights by being sports also chaired by al khalifi even their 50 million euros per year shirt sponsorship deal with the core hotels can be traced back to qsi who hold an 11 stake in the company however what cannot be denied is psg's success in breaking into new markets in 2019 deloitte ranked them as the fifth highest revenue generating club in europe on 636 million euros this was a 17 increase on the season before and jumped them ahead of liverpool and manchester city it also meant they became the 11th football club to break the 1 billion valuation mark while the signings of superstars like david beckham zlatan ibrahimovic and neymar helped put psg on the map much of their growth has been driven by intelligent expansion into new global markets one of the best examples of this happened in 2019 when nike agreed to pay psg 80 million euros per year until 2032 to keep manufacturing their shirts not only did this land the parisian one of the most lucrative kit deals in sport but included a collaboration with basketball legend michael jordan and the results were instantaneous that year they reached 1 million shirt sales internationally for the first time and attracted an endless stream of high-profile celebrities to the part to france along with appearances at the new york and paris fashion weeks psg have successfully cultivated a lifestyle brand that extends beyond the world of sport the club reckon they have 22 million supporters across north america who were previously untapped now the club has 15 official fan groups in the usa and 10 soccer schools spread across the country and even launched a pop-up store in new york it's a similar story in asia where psg have successfully opened outlets in shanghai and tokyo and became the first european club to launch a store in seoul south korea beyond merchandising they have aggressively expanded tv rights deals and entered product partnerships with various high-profile brands in the region pre-season tours across north america and asia have only helped to capitalize on that presence clever planning and a global strategy have transformed psg from an underperforming club to one of the most glamorous in the world the result is a decreased reliance on money from qatar pushing them towards a self-sustaining business model and a permanent place among sports commercial elite academy questions as part of al-khalifa's complete project the qatari owners have invested heavily in the cubs facilities plans were afoot to expand the park de pran's capacity to 60 000 having already spent 75 million euros improving seating and almost quadrupling the hospitality service this has seen their match day revenue swell around 5 times to 100 million euros per year and the club's training facilities are also set for a makeover since 1904 psg have practiced at com deluge in the saint germain district with its latest update coming in 2008 but by 2022 a new 300 million euro state of the art complex will open in the nearby district of quasi this will be the men's team's new base but the women's side will continue to train at comm deluge maintaining the link with saint germain it's worth mentioning that psg feminine have also dramatically improved under the new owners finishing runners-up in division on eight occasions and reaching the champions league final twice in the last decade also moving to the new complex will be the club's academy psg are in a unique position as the only major club in the city with some of the best footballing potential in the world on their doorstep prior to the takeover 80 of the french national side all came from the paris metropolitan area yet none played for psg and reversing this trend has been a central pillar within the qatari project from the start in fact al-khalifi declared his ambition to find and nurture the next lionel messi from within the city to execute this dream he increased the club's youth budget to 10 million euros annually heavy investment meant by 2019 the academy was named the best in france ahead of leon who had held the title for six seasons prior but for all their strides and improvements psg still don't boast a plethora of world-class youngsters in their first team rather they face the problem of seeing most of their best talent leave the club early on in the summer of 2019 psg sold a number of starlets including musa drb christopher unkunku and timothy ware for a combined amount of 54 million euros all aged under 21 and with the club since their early teens the year before was a similar story with jonathan ikone yasin adley and odson eduard leaving for less than 20 million euros and that's just the players who've been monetized musa dembele matteo guendouzi and kingsley comon are but a few of the high high-profile names who departed the park did prance to sign their first professional contract elsewhere today the trio boasts a combined market value over 112 million euros much to psg's horror there are a number of explanations for this exodus of talent the first psg club officials highlight is a rule in france that limits the length of a first professional contract to just three years with this restriction lifted elsewhere many head abroad to start their career such as dan axel zagadou and most recently tonki kuasi both playing in germany but in reality the problem lies closer to home the bankrolling of superstars may have catapulted psg towards title glory but as a result the majority of their talents simply doesn't have a pathway into the first team this was certainly the case with eduard komo and yabi and struck again last summer when adil aoshish rejected the club in favour of a move to santitian the 17 year old had been a huge success in the youth sides for both club and country but still decided to leave with his boyhood club earning nothing psg continued their defense by blaming agents chasing higher commission and signing on fees elsewhere and argue that if a player isn't good enough it's better to cash in on them to satisfy financial fair play they also point to academy products like present kimpembe who've been successful though most normally live on the fringes of the squad however the fact young parisians are regularly choosing clubs away from the capital reflects poorly on their image and having disbanded their reserve side in 2019 there are growing concerns that producing young talent is no longer the qatari's main priority for all al khalifa's talk of finding the next messi it may just be easier to buy the man himself conclusion behind the scenes psg have worked tirelessly to become one of the most lucrative clubs in the world with a sharp eye for modern day culture and trends this alone has earned them a place among football's elite however in the eyes of many purists they're not there yet neymar and bappy are the figureheads of the current regime but both face uncertain futures in the french capital with time running out to extend their deals and bappy in particular could be on the move with foreign suitors waiting in the wings should he leave a new superstar will be required and it's unlikely that figure will come from the academy as the brand grows larger so too does the reliance on big names for revenue and delivering immediate success the psg project has moved at an incredible pace and while a champions league title remains elusive there's little chance of the qatari owners slowing down to accommodate the next potential young star that could be the real final frontier stopping al halaifi from realising his vision of a complete psg project for as long as a pathway to the first team for young parisians remains blocked there'll always be something missing at the part de prance no matter how much they spend so that's our take on what's lacking from the psg project but what do you think is missing in paris let us know in the comments below if you enjoyed this video don't forget to give

Sports Investments (QSI) since their acquisition almost a decade ago. QSI aimed to elevate PSG to a renowned global brand and the most dominant club in France, leading to significant financial investments exceeding 1 billion euros. This investment brought top-tier players like Neymar and Mbappe and scrutiny over financial dealings, such as their partnership with the Qatar Tourism Board and broadcasting rights. While PSG successfully increased their market presence and generated significant revenue, including lucrative merchandising deals and expansion into markets in North America and Asia, questions remain about their sustainability and talent development. Despite investments in facilities and the youth academy, PSG has struggled to integrate homegrown talent into their first team, often losing promising players to other clubs. The transcript hints that the club's reliance on expensive superstar signings and the pursuit of immediate success may undermine the long-term development of local talent. The narrative paints PSG as a culturally savvy and financially robust entity but suggests their lack of a reliable path for youth players is a gap in their project's completeness.",Sportswashing,0,No,Paris Saint-Germain ownership,Qatar

a host of talented players to add to an already eye-oricting cast of superstars in the Autumn they're set off at the speed of light and break all the points records time spring comes around they get knocked out of the champions league and are disappointed with the consolation prize of a league R title or a domestic trophy but this time things have happened differently this time spring has come early in Paris [Music] specs the 2022-23 season has been nothing out of the ordinary for PSG after 23 games they found themselves top the table with 54 points having scored 55 goals and conceded 20. by contrast the previous season saw them pick up 56 points from 51 goals 4 and 19 goals against if you would prefer your numbers to be underlying then psg's expected goal difference per 90 minutes this season is at plus 1.06 according to fbref.com a touch ahead of the plus 0.97 that it was at last season things are very different though when you consider psg's form immediately before and after the World Cup since League are returned after the competition concluded psgf played eight games winning four drawing one and losing three they've also been knocked out of the Coupe De France by Marseille the underlying numbers reflect this turn of form in the eight games following the World Cup PSG had been running an unexpected goal difference for around plus 0.48 if you compare that figure to the expected goal difference for the eight games immediately Prestige the World Cup they're up at around plus 0.88 expected goal difference this is almost a 50 drop and raises the question of whether the World Cup broke PSG and although the 2022-23 season looks very similar on paper to previous PSG Seasons there have been some key differences first and foremost the club has had to tighten its belt in the wake of a number of financial issues rising from the lack of sustainability perhaps unsurprisingly for a club who are paying both Leo and Messi and Killian and bape's wages PSG ended the new season with an eye-watering wage to revenue ratio of around 109 the resulting losses that ensued the club are being monitored carefully by UEFA in line with the ffp regulations for the time being they agreed to a 65 million euro settlement to avoid further sanction because of this psg's football advisor Lewis Campos has been forced to rebuild their squad to cut wages and generate much needed Revenue the summer saw them move on nine players including aging Stars such as Angel Di Maria Georgina weinaldum Julian Draxler and maricardi they did bring in placements for many of these players color solar vitina nordi michiela Renata Sanchez Fabian Rhys and Hugo akatike but notably they only replaced nine outgoings with six incomings this allowed PSG to cut the wage bill at the club whilst building a score for the future however it's come to cost when they're able to play their best players Paris Saint-Germain looked everything like the league leaders they are but lose a couple and they start to lack depth this was the story at the beginning of the Season Christoph galtier had a system that suited the starting 11 a 343 with Lionel Messi killing and Bape and Neymar in the front three and PSG flew out of the blocks but on October problems arose presnell can bembe and Nino Mendes both got injured and Sergio Ramos was suspended after picking up a red card on top of this Killian mbappe announced on his Instagram page that he no longer wanted to play as a lone Striker but would prefer to play off the left-hand side the result was a 442 Diamond that solved both problems this worked well as a stop Gap but then the World Cup arrived when the players returned from Guitar there seemed to be a drop-off particularly from the Superstar front 3 both physically and mentally most importantly mbappe was sidelined for a long period while Neymar was also only available sporadically as for the motivational side Messi came back having won a World Cup mbappe having narrowly lost the World Cup and Neymar having failed to meet High expectation with Brazil any of those experiences could have had an impact on the players in question after the recent loss against Monaco in League R the Press reported that Lewis Campos gave several members of the team a dressing room reprimand for not giving their all in the game after the same fixture presnell can bembe used an ultra's loudspeaker to apologize to the fans the post-world cup return has seen PSG lose all the momentum that they picked up in the first half of the season galtier is now switching between back three formations and different iterations of the 442 shape sometimes with and sometimes without a diamond with key players out the lack of depth has become increasingly obvious with Gautier being forced to fit Square pegs into round holes at times this drop-off in form has come at the worst possible time for PSG the matchup against Bayern Munich in the round of 16 in the Champions League will be a tough

lBRMtyrW184,PSG's Qatari owners looking to invest in Premier League club and met with Spurs chairman Daniel Levy,foreign ERS of Paris saint-german are looking at investing in a Premier League club and it's emerged that the French club's president NASA Al khalifi met with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy in London last week now Spurs are not formally seeking investment or a buyout but Manchester United and Liverpool are open to such deals Qatar Sports investment which is also headed by Al khalifi is looking to expand its portfolio of clubs Beyond PSG and a stake in Portuguese club Braga when contacted by Sky Sports news though Tottenham denied that a meeting took place well let's get more on this now because these Sports Commercial advisor for jmw solicitors Ben Pepe joins us now good afternoon to you Ben let's start with this then what's in it for cattle then why now I think a couple of factors so you mentioned that Qatar have obviously already got a presence within European football with PSG with Braga and I think for any ownership group the Premier League is obviously an attractive investment um you've seen both a number of years ago in Manchester City and Abu Dhabi and more recently with Saudi Arabia and Newcastle that the gulf regions have grown their presence within the Premier League and I think there's certainly an element uh potentially of um the more NASA khalifi and and Qatar looking at looking at the Premier League and looking at the big six and going we potentially need to acquire either a minority investment into a club or gain a presence within the league to compete against our rival States and the timing is important as well we've seen the United and Liverpool have both come out publicly and said that they're open for investment and we obviously know that the World Cup was recently held in guitar and there's an element of building momentum and building Legacy off the back of that they would have had a very clear plan from the moment and they started preparing their World Cup bid to um hosting the World Cup to the heavy sponsorship that Qatar had within football um and a very clear strategy and as far as we can see PSG was was clearly at the Forefront of that and there's clearly an element that the Premier League and a big six Club within the Premier League will fall into that hence the conversations with Tottenham it's interesting though you Ben you bring up the subject of the World Cup because they came under a lot of criticism didn't they cater and there were suggestions that they'd lost interest in football after that heavy criticism so what do you feel the attraction is to owning dare I say multiple clubs around the world other than money I guess yeah so there's two separate points in that I think I think with regards to the multi-club ownership model it's the fastest growing ownership model in football currently we've obviously seen a city football group who are probably the The Benchmark for what a multi-club ownership model could look like and there are two different elements to what a multi-club ownership model actually could be so the first is the satellite model which is exactly what Manchester City have done they own what is a kind of a pinnacle European uh Global football club and then a number of satellite clubs across the world um and then you've got the horizontal model which is essentially where you acquire a number of clubs all operating a fairly similar level I think for Qatar if they were to obviously acquire a minority investment in Spurs Spurs certainly sit in some regard at the same level as as a PSG so um it's not necessarily the satellite model that Katara are going to be following um but it's hugely popular it can do a number of things obviously it can grow um Global brand awareness for the only ownership group we've seen it in the US for a very long time albeit across multiple Sports it's very common um across the pond for owners to own multiple franchises in different sports and I suppose within within football we clearly know that it's the most popular sport in the world and we know that the Premier League from both are viewership figures perspective I suppose but also from a commercial perspective um is the biggest league in the world so from any Investment Group who has the I suppose the financial capability to acquire assets that lend themselves to a significant opportunity in terms of football club ownership they're clearly going to look at the Premier League um and then I think from from a Qatari perspective um obviously off off the back of the World Cup as we discussed there's they they made a significant um development with PSG they bought it for a very small amount of money and it's now a global brand that's worth over 4 billion and with Spurs there's there's an opportunity with the infrastructure that's there and obviously the new stadium the club is is continuing to develop um and from a multi-club ownership model it could sit very nicely alongside um other football clubs that the the QSI have within their portfolio yeah Ben you mentioned PSG didn't you there I mean let's talk about those figures they bought it 70 million now worth 4 billion quite some investment isn't it um is this a good time do you think to buy a Premier League club right now so again there's obviously multiple answers to that question there's there's obviously the economic factors and the market conditions um and then there's also the Premier League and I alluded earlier to the fact that the Premier League is is the biggest football league in the world we know that it drives the most revenue from both a broadcast and a commercial perspective um and it I suppose it's that debate between winning at all costs against um the level level of investment right so you've seen Saud the the kind of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia um who have grown their presence in sport recently and as I mentioned earlier Abu Dhabi with Man City so I think from From qatar's perspective with regards to the Premier League specifically and whether it's a good time to buy um we know that a club like Spurs has got significant room for growth all the they just spent a significant amount of money on rebuilding their Stadium fantastic infrastructure managers fairly new so from a direct Club perspective I think it could be a really opportune time to continue to grow and the fact that they talk about minority Investments suggests not just a cash injection but also kind of leading it in a strategic Direction alongside the current ownership group and then in terms of the market factors so historically football clubs have not necessarily been the greatest Investments depending on whether you're buying a single Club a distress Club a lower league club but with regards to I suppose Tottenham specifically with regard to current market conditions the idea that values are sitting under probably where they have been previously will be true in line with what's going on within global economics within global politics conflicts across the world and so on but what I think from spurs's side is going to be hugely significant and hugely important to know is that Tottenham are on a growth project and there's there was news that broke um in the last few months around them looking at a potential naming rights partner for the stadium so be very interesting to see how the that plays out in line with potential investment into into Spurs because you spoke earlier about the Qatar World Cup and the controversy and um will Brands potentially stay away from the the stadium naming rights of Spurs in line with who who becomes an investor and on the flip side um if an investor does come into Spurs is there going to be other I suppose Clauses inserted into into the investment contracts to say well this is the presence we want within the stadium whether that's naming rights shirt sponsorships and a whole load of other things so very early days in the conversation but a lot to consider both from a Qatari side and also from a Tottenham Hotspur side yeah it's intriguing isn't it as you mentioned there so many things so many factors it'll affect the Premier League if they're to get involved as a whole yeah so I think Newcastle is obviously the most recent example to look at and a bit like with PSG and French football it's that debate of going do you want to win at all costs and with what comes with that is obviously investment and investment from very wealthy people and very wealthy States um versus do we want the competitive balance of the Premier League to shift and there is no doubt that Newcastle have taken on investment and they have had a massive turnaround in Fortune compared to where they were 12 months ago and whilst they signed very shrewdly and yes they've spent money albeit not a huge huge amount um there is certainly the the argument to suggest that upsetting I suppose the traditional competitive balance within the Premier League in terms of the top four in terms of the traditional big six is a good thing I think on the flip side to that we know the issues that surround various regions across the world not just the Gulf States um we saw it obviously significantly in the Press um and in broadcast and rightly so around Qatar in the world cup and and sponsors pulling out and sponsors um potentially um moving away from aligning themselves to clubs tournaments and so on that um had certain ownership structures and States behind them so I think it there's a there's a real debate there aligned to as I said kind of upsetting the competitive balance and not being a positive for a lot of people versus the kind of socio-political argument um around ownership groups and the due diligence that should be done aligned to new potential owners and what that means for the Premier League okay so just finally Ben there has been an example because we said you know they are owners of uh PSG so if any Spurs fans are watching right now let's beg the question have QSI been good then do you think for French football so it's similar to my answer with with Newcastle I think what QSI have done for French football is they've certainly put it on the map so there's that Global Superstar versus anti-competitive debate right so Lionel Messi Killian mbappe and a whole load of other superstars that have signed for Paris Sandra Martin um have led to an increased presence for French football across the world obviously from a from a PSG perspective as you alluded to earlier the the value of the club has risen dramatically and we're talking in billions not even hundreds of millions um which has probably generating more broadcast revenue for the the entirety of the French um the French leagues which trickles down to the clubs but then on the flip side again um the the the the fact that they have signed the superstars they have and the fact that the league is so top heavy in terms of PSG against I suppose the others suggests that actually it may not necessarily be the best product to watch because PSG ultimately are probably going to be winning the league every year and winning competitions and so on and so forth so there's that kind of commercial the competitive debate that exists for for French football and I suppose it will depend who you talk to as to whether they think having a global presence across the world is brilliant for French football and for France in general versus those that say they don't really enjoy watching Liga anymore because they know that PSG is just going to win the league every year probably similar to what what Leon actually did a number of years ago and now PSG took over the I suppose that success in line with with their investment okay brilliant stuff really interesting to talk to you thank you very much ben thank you [Music],"The transcript discusses Qatar Sports Investments' interest in expanding its football club portfolio to the Premier League, with potential minority investments in clubs like Tottenham Hotspur. Despite Tottenham denying a recent meeting, there's speculation from other commentators that Qatar is looking to compete with other successful Gulf-owned clubs like Manchester City and Newcastle United. The discussion explores the appeal of multi-club ownership models, comparing them to City Football Group’s structure, and considers the positive branding and financial outcomes already witnessed with Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) under Qatari ownership. Additionally, the transcript touches on the commercial opportunities associated with owning Premier League clubs, emphasizing the league's global viewership and commercial potential. Concerns about geopolitical motivations, financial injections, and strategic direction fluctuations are also raised, reflecting the existing dynamics in the Gulf region's investments in the football world. It also highlights the ongoing debate about whether such investments improve or disrupt competitive balance within leagues. The transcript also references criticisms Qatar faced during their hosting of the World Cup and explores how public perception and sponsorship decisions might affect future investments in English football. The potential influence of such investments on Premier League clubs, emphasizing a mix of financial benefits and market uncertainties are also discussed. The conversation ends by considering the dual effects of Qatari investment on French football and the shift in league dynamics following PSG's expansion, echoing similar outcomes that may occur in the Premier League.",Geopolitical Influence,0,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Qatar
LZn3i2YZ1BA,How Saudi Arabia Is Disrupting Football,foreign Saudi Arabia announced a revamped Saudi pro league with the country's Sovereign wealth fund taking ownership of the country's four largest clubs now let's see and El NASA were chosen with the further four teams receiving investment from other state-owned companies and world-class players have already begun to arrive headed by Cristiano Ronaldo joining al-nasa in January and Karen Benzema signing for aletiad as the summer began with stratospheric contracts that European clubs can't match many more are expected to join the message is clear Saudi Arabia wants to disrupt World football [Music] Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is on a one-man journey to transform how his nation is seen by the global Community but also its own 35 million people Saudi Arabia is Infamous for a scourge of Human Rights abuses and in combating that reputation plus appeasing a rapidly growing and Youthful population MBS as a lighted on sport for example government sources have indicated to the athletic that Saudi Arabia is aiming to host 25 World Championships across a number of sports by 2030. the bid for that year's World Cup or the 2034 Edition is very likely and 24 hours after the pro-league announcement it was shockingly revealed that the PGA Tour was merging with pif-funded upstart live golf sport matters to saudi's population 70 of which is under 35 and it's also football obsessed since Ronaldo joined attendance at El Nasa games is up by 143 percent that is now set to multiply across the league and Global publicity is a key part of the Saudi plan according to MBS one key strategic objective is to create qualitative opportunities and an attractive environment for investment in the sports sector one key motivation behind his vision 2030 master plan is to divert the Saudi economy away from fossil fuels the aim is to Triple the League's market value through a combination of commercial revenue and private sector investment and since Ronaldo joined ticket prices have also gone up another potential impact heavily briefed by competition organizers are potential public health benefits the government is Keen to improve the statistic that some 60 of the population are overweight or obese one aim given by yes El Micha the president of the Saudi Arabian Football Federation is to increase the number of registered male players from 21 000 to more than two hundred thousand but of course Vision 2030 is also about self-perception Simon Chadwick a professor of sport and geopolitical economy at schema business school says that what MBS and his advisors don't want is gangs of 26 year old guys taking to the streets and plotting to overthrow the royal family because they have to live their lives differently to the rest of the world essentially what the government is now doing is saying well if you want Cristiano Ronaldo we'll give them to you but the flip side to that is that they don't want to be questioned so far this year there have been more arrests of people in Saudi Arabia for posting negative comments about the government than ever before the contract is that you can have whatever you want but don't question us mbs's desire to appeal to the country at large is visible from the choice of clubs to receive private investment not only is it the four largest clubs in Saudi Arabia but also El katzia in the Eastern region and Ela the homeland of the ancient tamudi tribe both keeping the provinces on side elderia from the birthplace of wahhabism has also received funding now plans for the 2023-24 season will see each of the four pif owned teams Target a minimum of three world-renowned names per Club a smaller number of world-renowned players are expected to be distributed among other sides in the league too executives are expected to be parachuted in while the nation is also expected to become a destination for more European managers saudi's aim is to become one of the top 10 leagues in the world by 2030 but as of January according to the sports intelligence agency 21st group the Saudi pro league was the 58th highest quality league in the world but despite that current lack of status Global interest is ramping up now lastly the smallest of the four have 2.4 million Twitter followers which would actually place them around 10th in the Premier League al-nasir with the largest following have more than every team in England outside the big six high value deals with European broadcasters will be negotiated leading to an improvement in commercial facilities one criticism of Saudi football historically has been a lack of facilities outside one or two key venues this influx of talent is likely to supercharge that development with pif's backing spending is expected to become more efficient so for the highest profile names like Ronaldo and Benzema a life of luxury awaits but this of course is not necessarily the case for everybody else FIFA's website details a swath of decisions from its dispute resolution chamber and contract breaches are common over 50 labor disputes involving Saudi clubs have been heard inside the past 12 months across the league with claims of wages unpaid when injured and in the worst cases contracts being torn up and visas withheld Thief bro the international Union representing 65 000 footballers warned in the summer of 2022 that its members should not sign for clubs in Saudi Arabia it was listed alongside repeat offenders such as Algeria China Romania and turkey as Nations to avoid with non-payment of salaries seen to be a recurring problem in Saudi the athletic has been told that public warning has done little to solve the issue but the true depth of payment problems is unclear there is no players union to represent natives to Saudi and as such no point of recourse for any locals going without pay so as the Saudi Ambitions grow broader and Bolder and the pro-league

Sovereign Wealth Fund taking control of the four largest clubs. It highlights Saudi Arabia's recruitment of world-class players like Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, offering massive contracts to enhance global appeal and disrupt world football. The initiative is part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 plan, which targets diversifying the economy away from fossil fuels by bolstering the sports sector. This includes hosting global sports championships and potentially a World Cup bid. The Saudi government aims to triple the league's market value through commercial and private investments while improving public health and increasing registered male players. The transcript conveys Saudi Arabia's efforts to reform its global image and prevent dissent among its youth by providing entertainment through sports, while suppressing criticism of the government. Issues around human rights remain as people face arrests for criticizing the government. Concerns over payment and contract breaches for foreign players in the league are highlighted, with FIFPRO advising against signing there due to unpaid salaries and unresolved disputes. There's no established players' union to address these issues for local players. The transcript discusses how Saudi Arabia aims to elevate its league to the world's top 10 by 2030 despite currently ranking low. It emphasizes the growth in popularity and media attention following high-profile signings, which is expected to attract European managers and players. However, improvement in commercial facilities is needed, with a historical lack of infrastructure being a limitation. Broadcast deals with European networks are anticipated, which could aid financial and facility advancements.

It highlights that Saudi Arabia seeks to diversify its global reputation beyond oil production and religious significance by hosting prominent sports figures like Cristiano Ronaldo. The narrative compares the situation to hypothetical scenarios where fans would travel internationally to watch sports icons like Michael Jordan, emphasizing the cultural and marketing impact rather than direct financial returns.

While players such as Cristiano Ronaldo have excelled in the league and served as effective ambassadors, others like Jordan Henderson have been quick to leave, and Benzema has shown intent to exit despite his significant contract. This situation presents a negative image for the league. It is noted that dissatisfaction among players is rumored, with Al Nasr's Emir Laporte pointing out issues such as low attendance, high temperatures, and cultural differences as potential hurdles for the league's growth.

5slVNMFT0_g,Why Saudi Arabia Is Betting Big On Soccer And Cristiano Ronaldo,"Saudi fans celebrated the
arrival of football legend Cristiano Ronaldo in Riyadh
Tuesday. Benzema is the latest soccer
megastar to join Cristiano Ronaldo in the Saudi League. Brazilian footballer Neymar is
leaving Paris Saint-Germain to join Saudi Pro League side
Al-Hilal. Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar are
among the most popular players in the world. There are among
the best players in the world. And this is what we're doing by
bringing household names like that to the Saudi League. We are
elevating the level of play. The big stars like Ronaldo and
Neymar are an affirmation for the Saudis that they want to
come there and play in country. They want to help them grow
sport, they want to help affect positive trajectory of that
country over the next 20-30 years. The decision of Saudi Arabia to
promote the Saudi League and attract some of the world's top
stars threatens to disrupt the traditional order of soccer.
Traditionally, soccer has been dominated by the weak European
leagues. And this is the first time that really significant
threat has been posed by an outside league. Public Investment Fund is Saudi
Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. it was actually established in
1971. Now it is the leading engine that is leading what we
call Saudi Vision 2030. It is investing strategically both
inside the Arabia as well as internationally. It is investing
in 13 different strategic sectors that include aerospace,
information technology, housing, entertainment, construction,
healthcare, and you name it. Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman, Saudi Arabia's de facto leader chairs the fund's board.
His love for soccer is universally known, and it became
even more evident when he inspired King Salman to declare
a public holiday after their country beat Argentina in the
early stages of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. In 2021, the PIF bought a
majority stake in the English soccer club Newcastle United in
2023. The Piaf took over four major domestic soccer clubs,
Al-Ittihad, Al-Nassr, Al-Hilal and Al-Ahli. Saudi Pro League is the top
men's professional soccer league in Saudi Arabia. So like most
countries, they have a national league which is popular and
people follow. And what's happening here is that the
government through the investment fund is channeling
money into the clubs so that they can acquire players. The Saudis just like MLS just
like any league in the world would love to have the greatest
player in our league. And we admire and respect what they're
doing to build their league in Saudi Arabia. And we think as
the sport grows globally, that eventually is good for Major
League Soccer. Saudi Pro League and investment
in Newcastle Unitedl, I think the PIF takes the view that you
can increase the profile of Saudi Arabia and investment in
sport both domestically and internationally. Needless to say the popularity
of the Saudi Pro League is nowhere near the European
leagues. During the 2021/ 2022 financial year, the English
Premier League generated nearly $7 billion in revenue, whereas
the Saudi Pro League made around $120 million. Clearly, if top stars are going
to Saudi Arabia, which gives credibility to the league,
credibility to the teams. Then with that comes legitimacy and
it is seen as being valid, realistic and important place to
play. And so as a consequence of that you do see others begin to
follow, and clearly there has been this multiplier effect this
year. First, Ronaldo, then Benzema, then N'Golo Kante,
Riyad Mahrez, and maybe others will follow too. This kind of
icon strategy associated with the pro league is one way of not
just attracting human resources, attracting talent, attracting
the best possible elite professional athletes. It's also
a way of building engagement with fans as well. The EPL is averaging 40,000 fans
per match, generally,.Saudi Arabia is averaging 9000 fans
per match.  So one could ask why would you invest all that money
into a property that's drawing 9000 fans? It's a long term
effort. And it's not just about that team. It's not just about
that league. It's about the nation state itself. The Premier League has been
established for well over 100 years in terms of English
football, the likes of Manchester United and Liverpool
and Manchester City and Chelsea. They have global fan bases, and
Manchester United at over 1.1 billion supporters according to
the club itself. So it's think it's unrealistic for clubs like
Al Hilal to expect to compete with Real Madrid, Barcelona,
Bayern Munich, Manchester United and so on. This is definitely a journey.
This is not just a one weekend. We've set off to achieve this
objective to be one of the top 10 leagues in the world. So, we
do have a mission and that is to kind of unleash the potential
that we have to drive change. PGA Tour and its Saudi back
competitor LIV Golf along with Europe's PGA World Tour have
agreed to merge, an expectation of creating a global entity for
the game of golf. The oil rich country hasn't been
shy from splurging cash in sports and other events. The
merger between the PGA and the Saudi backed LIV Golf is a prime
example. Saudi sovereign wealth fund,
PIF, which created LIV to invest significant untold what will be
billions of dollars in 2018, Saudi Arabia signed a
10 year deal with World Wrestling Entertainment to host
events in their country, a deal reportedly worth 100 million a
year. In 2021 the kingdom hosted the
Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, a Formula One motor racing event
for the first time. In the same year, Saudi Arabia
signed a three year deal worth $25 million with Lionel Messi to
promote their tourism. Critics argue that Saudi Arabia is using
sports as a tool to distract from the real issues in the
country, a term known as 'sportswashing'. The murder of Saudi journalist
Jamal Khashoggi and 2018, for example, remains a controversial
flashpoint in Saudi relations. Furthermore, the country is also
notorious for its crackdown on freedom of expression and
peaceful dissent. Human Rights Watch said that a Saudi court
sentenced a man to death in July. His crime, criticizing
country's leadership on Twitter. The nonprofit's recent report
highlights that dozens of Saudi human rights defenders and
activists remain imprisoned for critiquing authorities or
advocating for political and rights reforms. First, we should think about
what we mean by the term 'sportswashing'. What we mean is
that a nation or a organization is using their involvement in
sport in order to project a positive image of themselves,
perhaps a more positive image that everybody else has. Nothing
happens in Saudi Arabia without that being something that the
ruling family wants to happen and that MBS wants to happen. So
there's no question that he's behind this. And of course, he
has an image of his own that he needs to whitewash, as best he
can. So he's must certainly be hoping that this kind of
investment will help promote a better image, not just to Saudi
Arabia, but all himself. I've always said that if you
just hold an Olympic Games, or if you just hold a FIFA World
Cup in a country, and expect the money to roll in, or the people
rolled in, or clouds to part to the sun to shine and it won't
happen. It has to be part of a much broader strategy. The notion that we are investing
in promoting sports, simply to improve our standing in the eyes
of others or in the international community.
Frankly, we find that a little bit offensive, it's a little
insulting. And that's why I need to stress this point, every
single measure that is taking place in Saudi Arabia, every
reform measure every initiative, every program that is currently
being implemented in Saudi Arabia, is being implemented for
one of two major reasons.It is either being implemented to
advance the interests of Saudi Arabia as a country, or to
improve the lives of Saudi people, or both. So every other
consideration is a distant second. We take the preservation and the
protection of human rights very seriously. We are proud of our
human rights record, we have passed a number of reforms over
the last few years. You know, we take care of our Saudi people,
we are more than happy to address these issues and these
allegations, frankly, we find to be baseless, and frankly, quite
biased. We tend to use sport as a
shorthand for understanding what countries are like, and Saudi
Arabia understands this. And so he's seeking to project soft
power, I think through sports so that we don't think about Saudi
Arabia in a bad way, we begin to think about Saudi Arabia in a
different way, possibly even a positive way. There is immense competition
amongst the Gulf nations for prestige and international
recognition. And there's no doubt that Qatar's hosting of
the 2022 World Cup will have raised some jealousies amongst
other Saudi nations and it's likely that this is the motive
for trying to build up the Saudi league in order to make Saudi
Arabia a potentially an attractive venue for a World Cup
and therefore, put it on a par if you like giving equal status
with Qatar. They want to project an image of
themselves as a progressive nation. And one way they might
further cement that is by winning a bid to host the World
Cup in 2030 or beyond and building up at the Saudi league
may well be part of that strategy. We have a predominantly young
population that loves soccer that is not only watching saw
Soccer, they're playing soccer. We have one of the world's
fastest growing tourism sectors in the world, people who are
coming to Saudi Arabia are also flocking and attending some of
these entertainment events, some of these sporting events. So we
believe that we have the right formula for success. And you
know, time will tell but I'm certainly very optimistic. When a place like Saudi Arabia
invests in a sport like soccer, suddenly the focus on soccer is
higher than it's ever been before. That's good for the
fans. That's good for the sport. However, when Saudi invest in
soccer, people around the world are also starting to look at
Saudi Arabia with the new light, sometimes good, sometimes bad.
So there are two sides to every discussion. That's what's
happening with this investment and that's a good thing.
Sunshine on all of this is a good thing.","The transcript discusses Saudi Arabia's investments in global sports, particularly in football, as a strategic move under the Saudi Vision 2030 initiative. This vision aims to diversify its economy and project a positive national image through sports. The narrative begins with football megastars like Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, and Neymar joining the Saudi Pro League, highlighting Saudi Arabia's effort to elevate its sports profile and break traditional European dominance.

PmRQlxjUcOI,"Henry, Carra & Micah's honest opinion of the Saudi Pro League! | UCL Today | CBS Sports Golazo",me how concerned do you think European football should be how challenged will it be by the Saudi pro league I think right now it's it's a slight worry that could certainly grow and that was my fear over the summer I don't think it's quite materialized the way I I faced field in that it still feels like it's pleasure of coming to the end of their career who are still making that move my fear when the you know the transfer window was open in the middle of the summer was we just need one player who's maybe what we class in his prime and then that could just be a knock-on effect and lots of players going now it's nothing against uh Saudi Arabia's league as such but I just think with the money involved that's why people are going there obvious that I think it'd be a real sad day for football if players in their Prime were not playing in the biggest leagues which are the Premier League La Liga Syria the Bundesliga and the champions league and not just because we do this show this for me is the cream of the crop even more than probably better quality than International Football and I think if players in the prime were giving up that to go somewhere just for money I think it'd be a really sad day for football but I don't think we're there yeah what they want they're older I mean when you said those grumbles about a bappa going if mbappy would have went there it would have been a sad day I I think for European football I don't I don't I don't there's a a real worry I I believe that the the best players still want to play in Europe in the Champions League still the biggest League yeah there will be players who go there of course I always think it's them players who are sort of not quite ready for the top four and they're thinking okay well where can I go to get my last big payday we're seeing it with China do you remember um the Chelsea boy Oscar went out there and yeah they will have their time it might last for a couple of years but ultimately I think the best players still want to play in Europe what if you're American soccer and MLS How concerned should you be about this development yeah but that that's more of a concern I think uh I I would say exactly what uh what Jaime and Micah said about I don't think that yet European football is in danger I will mention Killian I think Killian saved the day because I think it's Killian went then it would have been a bit different I think a lot of people would have followed around his age and what he does represent so I was was happy that it didn't go you can understand some of the guys that that won what they want at a certain age and one day but I think yes the MLS and other leagues will suffer because they're not getting the players that they used to get I went to the MLS for example uh I was it was because I also choose a certain lifestyle I wanted to be in New York still playing football so so I went there but you know one of the main concerns I guess with with the the league in Saudi Arabia is that is the human rights that are bothering people a lot and how they feel about the lb gtq plus Community that's what people I think are upset with why some of the players are going there because of the human rights and what I just mentioned before and so it becomes a problem but when you talk about money uh you know we've seen it before we've seen players sometimes live in South America leaving their country living Africa living other countries in Europe to get a better life and earn more money which We call we can all understand because I've been in a situation where like who will refuse what they've been offered well Killian did I don't know about the rest of the world I did I wasn't for example in that situation with that league and I mentioned it here on the show before I've been offered five times my salary at a time I stayed where I was so that was when he was in your Prime yeah no no like like I'm just saying that I refused it but some people sometimes talk without being in that position what's your motivation it depends like I'm sure uh Jimmy we never have left Liverpool because because Liverpool is everything for him but some people have different motivations for some people it's money and when it comes to money at times people react a different way but when it comes to Human Rights and and what we talked about before then you can be obviously a problem for a lot of people but I'm nobody to judge anyone you know and and sometimes when people ask me do you think they should have done this or done or done that I'm not in someone's shoe to know exactly how it is at that particular moment when it's going to take that decision I know I didn't do it it wasn't the same you know a b talking about where I was and where I was supposed to go but the salary was the same five times my salary I didn't go do you judge anybody who just choose that and make that decision and make that no I'm a little bit with tiering because I think until you're in that position yourself uh it's easy to say oh he shouldn't have done that but what I would say it's here to just mentioned because I was at Liverpool now a lot of players from Liverpool have gone this summer and I do view them differently in the situations that they're in and this is just purely from a football and point of view in that Jordan Henderson is the one player who has been heavily criticized I haven't really seen anybody else get criticized I'm not sure about you know maybe in Spain with Benzema or players from different countries I'm not sure but in England it's mainly just being Jordan Henderson and nobody else now the thing with Jordan Henderson was he was the captain of Liverpool at the time when he left now I put myself in his position and I probably think if I was the captain of Liverpool yes he may not have played as much going forward you know that that was clear but I'm not sure I would have give that up if I'm being totally honest I was Captain Liverpool Roberto firmino who's contract had come to an end and was a real big part play over the last two years I can understand you know I get that uh so I can I can understand the battle for me no going there so it depends on the personal circumstances yeah everyone's got a different story and that goes back to theater until you're in those shoes you can't really say but looking from my own club's point of view uh that's how I see I see both of those situations but what you've also got to say is we're criticizing players for going and different reasons for why they got but no one's criticizing the clubs there's a lot of Premier League clubs especially who are absolutely delighted to cash in to cash in a special Liverpool let's be totally honestly Liverpool got over 50 million for two players who looked like last season they were coming to the end of their Liverpool create or playing weekend week out in uh fabino and Jordan Henderson so we can plug the fingers at players and you know rightly so but also there's a lot of clubs out there who are thinking when they can't shift a player I over Saturday Club comes in the always falls on the player on the players and and I think at them yes players are powerful they should stand for something but not only them like everybody is involved in football and and it always falls to the players the same thing when the World Cup was in Qatar suddenly they all come and ask the players not to go and like like they're not going to play the World Cup like you have politicians that should be dealing with that and so sometimes I feel like the players are taking hostage if you know what I mean like what are you going to do about it you're like well the World Cup is Nikita like what do you need to do about it I want to play The Walker you know I could see it with the players they didn't know what to say they don't know what to do and politicians out there to do their job also so why is always Sport and players which act understand stand that we can move stuff don't get me wrong but don't forget about the politicians that are not some time coming out and talk when they should talk [Applause] [Music],"The transcript involves a discussion on the impact of the Saudi Pro League on European football and other global leagues like the MLS. It expresses concerns about potentially losing top players in their prime to the Saudi league due to lucrative offers, which could diminish the quality and competition in established European leagues. There is an emphasis on notable players like Kylian Mbappé, who declined a move to Saudi Arabia, setting an example that stabilizes current migration fears. The discussion touches on human rights concerns, notably the treatment of the LGBTQ+ community, which is a factor causing discomfort for some players and fans regarding moves to Saudi Arabia. Despite financial temptations, there are broader discussions on player motivations, with many making decisions based on personal circumstances. Criticism also falls on football clubs that willingly sell players for profit while less criticism is directed at the clubs compared to the players themselves. There's a sentiment that the expectation for players to take a stand on these issues is disproportionate, emphasizing the need for political action rather than placing the burden solely on athletes.",Sportswashing,0,No,Saudi Pro League,Saudi Arabia
KVFterzsmOg,Why The Saudi Pro League Is Already Falling Apart,"on summer transfer deadline day the Saudi pro league went hell for leather in their pursuit of Liverpool's Muhammad Salah an offer of more than £150 million from El had was rejected by the Reds who reportedly ruled out selling Sal of that window even for a world record-breaking £215 million Al it had were reported to have been willing to pay Salah 2.45 million a week which also would have been a world record plus a £55,000 bonus and lucrative endorsement deals with three major Saudi state-owned companies Liverpool refused to budge Salah never forced the issue and in the end the Saudis ran out of time with a strong suspicion that they would come back for Salah who is undoubtedly the biggest football superstar in the Arab or Muslim World in 2024 though the Saudi pro league had missed out on Salah they were able to get over the line deadline dat deals to sign Lis Felipe from Ral Bettis deari Gray from Everton and former Luton brenford Burnley and Watford Striker Andre Gray from Greek outfit Aris Salah would have provided the finishing touches to a window which had seen the likes of Neymar Karen benzar Angolo kante Riad mahrez s mané and Jordan Henderson joined five time Balon door winner Cristiano Ronaldo in Saudi Arabia as the Saudi pro league outspent every other league in World football barring the Premier League despite signing predominantly older players with less market value and handed out a whole series of salaries that were and still are without precedent in the history of football it was expected that in the January window the Saudis would come again if not necessarily for Salah then for a Lany of other superstars including a possible low move for lonel Messi during the Major League Soccer off season less than 5 months on from the League's last deadline day in which they scrambled to sign one of the biggest names in World football for a Rec record fee and wage the Saudi Pro League's January window shut quietly earlier this week on the same day that I turned 28 to about as much fanfare for context I went to a Turkish restaurant with my girlfriend my mom brought me around a cake and I contemplated the slow but incessant March towards my own death there were no links with Salah or Messi this time around or even the Str of players below that in fact only one player joined the Saudi pro league for a feedus window and that was Brazilian left back rayan Loi who spent last season on loan at Nottingham Forest and joined Al hillal from Marseilles there was one big name deadline day arrival namely that of a 35-year-old Ian rakitic who joined al-shabab though even then he was only replacing fellow veteran former severe star Ava bager who returned to Argentina arguably the biggest transfer involving the Saudi pro league this window was actually Jordan Henderson who left fellow former Liverpool Captain Steven Gerard's team alac after less than six months having successfully spread football around the globe and sullied his own reputation so much so that he was booed by England fans in October at a friendly against Australia all hail hendo just you watch I better have Dutch people interested in football before long the man's a miracle worker but why the sudden change intact it's not as though Saudi Arabia has run out of money people still buying oil it's not as though it is mission accomplished in terms of improving Saudi Arabia's image or making domestic football more lucrative attendances at games and on television have fallen far short of many Insider expectations and it's not as though Saudi Arabia has halted investments in sport overall the 2023 Riad season has seen the nation host high-profile boxing matches tennis tournaments and football Super cups even there though there have been problems Henderson you see isn't the only person to have been booed of the 2023 Spanish super cup semi-final between Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid fans Boo and J or in a minute silence for Germany Legend France beckenbauer prompting questions about whether the already Under Fire RF should really be hosting their tournaments in Saudi Arabia solely for financial gain still it could always have been worse the 20 23 Turkish super cup also meant to have been held in Riyad had to be cancelled after the Saudi authorities denied Galatasaray and feder's requests to celebrate the 100-year anniversary of turkey becoming a republic leading to both teams refusing to play elsewhere Karen benzar Roberto firmino and jota are all reportedly unhappy but word and I January moves elsewhere one of the four PF own clubs Ali had are in crisis America reporters talked of widespread discontent among foreign players and some Saudi pro league players despite being paid millions of dollars monthly by state-owned clubs have chosen to live outside of Saudi Arabia and commute in for training and games so just what on Earth is going on well that's a question that I've been asked a lot over the last month which means regrettably that's what today's video is all about so sit back relax and join me on yet another journey to Saudi Arabia I feel like we've been there more times than most diplomats and arms dealers over the last 12 months at this stage as we take a look at why Saudi pro league clubs was so quiet in the most recent January transfer window why several big names signing supposedly want to leave and where the Saudi Arabia's football project really is already disintegrating even faster than China's though there are undoubtedly some problems are foot for the Saudi pro league which we will obviously come on to it's probably worth Beginning by making the League's own case for them and acknowledging some of the understandable reasons why the January window was never likely to be as Extreme as the summer one for a start Saudi pro league team signed Neymar and benzar in the summer window having already recruited Cristiano Ronaldo just over a year ago now they also had failed in Pursuits of lonel Messi Killian mbappe and Muhammad Salah none of whom ever seem likely to leave their current clubs mid-season in mbappe and Salah case or just 6 months into a 2 and 1 half year contract in the case of Messi from that level of ambition and investment the only way was down unless they could somehow convince erling Harland and Jude Bellingham to sacrifice their careers at 23 and 20 and even then probably at a cost of about a billion pound for the pair of them then you've got simple regulatory issues the Saudi pro league may not be bound to any kind of financial fair play or profit and sustainability restrictions and it is a good job because they would fail all of them far more spectacularly than any club in the history of European football but they still have some internal regulations you may recall that when Al nase signed Cristiano Ronaldo in what was really the first Blockbuster Saudi pro league signing and is arguably still the biggest it resulted in Cameron Captain Vincent abubakar being forced out abubakar in fact volunteered to leave the club following Ronaldo's arrival from Manchester United but only because he was aware of the Saudi Pro League's foreign player quota which meant that one of al- NASA's foreign players would have to be offloaded to make way for the Portuguese Superstar and he probably assumed that as a forward it was likely to be him Al Nasser reportedly weren't that Keen on getting rid of abubakar had even enlisted Ronaldo's help in an effort to convince him to stay but by then the damage had already been done abubakar subsequently rejoined bikas for his third stin at the club though he was excluded from the squad in December for poor performance along with Eric baay and G Anana the Saudi pro league allows for a maximum of eight foreign players in every team squad plus an extra spot for foreign Nationals who were born in Saudi Arabia and following such a wild summer spending spree many clubs are at that limit in fact every Club other than Abba who are down to seven having lost Cameroon Joo deis aasi and coko aami and Iraqi sard ATI this season are at the maximum number of eight and roughly half have more than eight if you're wondering how that works well just as in the Premier League if you have more than the number of registerable players or players eligible to be registered you have to leave some of them out of your squad Saudi pro league teams have ended up in a situation where former lead United star ezan alioski is unregistered at Al Ali Sweden's Robin Kaizen is unregistered at alac Neymar is out in the cold due to his ACL injury at alhilal Englishman Mo Adams can't yet be registered for Al khalish despite having only just joined them former Dutch Wonder kid Adam marah is off the books at damak and most remarkably of all aliak have two players who are currently unregistered as a result of alac having 10 foreign players in their current Squad plus Egyptian National Nerin albajar who was born in Saudi Arabia and is therefore able to be registered that means that in order to sign any foreign players whatsoever Saudi pro league teams with the sole exception of ABBA now must sell one or more of their foreign players fast buying and selling players is of course part and parcel of football for all clubs but it becomes increasingly difficult when you're paying an aging player four five six heck even 10 times as much as they could possibly hope to earn anywhere else most of you watching this can probably think of a player that your Club has signed on a lot of money where it hasn't quite worked out but because of their salaries it has proved very difficult to shift them the most famous or inFAMOUS example paps is surely Winston Bogard who played nine Premier League games in four years at Chelsea and I think none in his last three but refused to leave the club because no one else would offer him anything like the what was then an extortioner £440,000 a week that he was on a similar problem ultimately led to Leicester City's relegation last season the foxes much like several Saudi clubs had a bloated Squad which prevented them from registering any new players and while they had lots of interest in all of their best players who they were desperate to keep they had next to no interest in their squad players often unsignificantly inflated salaries who had failed to perform it prevented Lester from being able to operate in the transfer market backup goalkeeper Alex smiies was their only summer arrival prior to the start of last season until sent back vout F join from r on Deadline day and that was it despite the 75 million sale of Wesley for far to Chelsea it's a problem at all clubs to a degree unless they have absolutely Flawless recruitment but for Saudi pro league clubs it's like Leicester City last season which was itself a fairly extreme example but on so many steroids that it could win the Tour to France forget the fact that the Saudi pro league is a league and people compete in the tour France not leagues you're overthinking the analogy all right the point being it's like that but a lot worse of course in order to Temp players to Saudi Arabia an arid desert Nation with little domestic football pedigree a league which is ranked below some second Ser in Europe and one of the most authoritarian and repressive states in the world the Saudis didn't just have to offer players a little bit more money than they could earn in more hospitable countries and competitive leagues but far far far more forget about Ronaldo Neymar and Benzema who the Saudi states have made the three highest PID players on the planet with benar increasing his 28 million euro a year salary at Real Madrid to a reported €10 million a year deal at aletti fact it is the players below them who are almost more remarkable and more relevant in this context at least just take Seiko fana the Ivory Coast midfielder who joined Al Nasser from Len in the summer but moved on again in the January window joining fellow Saudi pro league side elac under Steven Gerard instead fana earns a reported 15.2 million EUR a season in Saudi Arabia which is about £250,000 or $315,000 a week that is more than Bernardo silver and rodri two of the best midfields in the world earn at Manchester City all be it Sila was reportedly offered half a million pounds a week to move to Saudi Arabia in the the summer but turned it down say for example theal Nas who are one of the big four directly PF owned Saudi pro league clubs wanted to offload a foreign player in order to free up an extra foreign player slot and fana was the player that they decided to get rid of seriously who on Earth is going to sign him ffer is probably on five times what he earns at Len at least twice if not three times as much as he could hope to earn anywhere outside of Saudi Arabia and that's before you even get into the € 25 million euro fee that alnaser paid just 6 months ago and which no one would now pay for the 28y old that is exactly what happened with fana with the solution being to loan him to alac who had an additional foreign player slots open up after Jordan Henderson forced his way out of the club after just 6 months essentially the Saudi pro league has just shifted the burden of thetha who isn't a bad player by the way he is a very good one he just never worth £250,000 a week and didn't seem to fit in at Al Naser from one club to another because no team outside of Saudi Arabia without access to Saudi State resources and the motives of the Saudi state to invest such ludicrous sums of money into the sport would touch him with a 10-ft pole unless as in the case of Henderson the player themselves is so determined to leave that they are willing to take a massive pay cut in order to move elsewhere of course even when players do want to leave there are few instances in which they're going to be prepared to do just that and so you end up in the situation that the Saudi pro league currently finds itself in just 6 months on from the League's wild spending spree lumbered with a whole load of players who whether they are happy in Saudi Arabia and whether their clubs are happy with them are near enough impossible to shift funnily enough this was previously the case with some of these exact same players before the Saudi pro league EXP exploded onto the scene Chelsea would have found it near enough impossible to offload a 32-year-old khu kabali for nothing when he was on £160,000 a week last summer let alone the17 million that they received for him from Al hillal fabino moved around the Liverpool Midfield with all of the gal energy and Agility of a wardrobe last season and it is doubtful that anyone else would have matched or exceeded the £180,000 a week that he ears at Liverpool and Bayern Munich would have run into similar difficulties offloading former red star sadio mané following a disappointing debut campaign at the alian arena when he was on an enormous reported £320,000 a week we saw the exact same thing with the Chinese Super League though it was often portrayed as being a challenger League or as a threat to Europe's Elite and there were one or two Jitters within boardrooms when Alex Tesa chose Jang susing ahead of both Liverpool and Chelsea in reality by and large at least it was actually a net positive for top European teams and leagues once again no one else would have paid Chelsea more than 50 million P for Oscar were not for xiin ping in the CCP greenlighting enormous Chinese investments in football and not many clubs other than guanga evergrand would have been falling over themselves to take pinho of tottenham's hands after he falls so far short of expectations in his debut campaign in North London so the difficulty of moving on players they've already signed who perhaps haven't worked out is one problem as is the cap on foreign players except of course for the fact that the reason there's no ffp or Ps in Saudi Arabia is because they control their own internal market and regulations and for obvious reasons they don't want any spending or loss regulations because almost all of their clubs are currently spending and losing mounds of cash and that is all part of the plan if they wanted to increase their foreign player quota there from 8 to 10 or even from 8 to 12 players just as they have increased it from 4 to8 since the 201617 season in order to facilitate a whole raft of new big money and big name Acquisitions they very easily could in some ways then their arguments only kicks the can down the road so why haven't they well there are a few hypotheses one is that Saudi Arabia's Mass investments in football was all centered around the desire to host the FIFA World Cup and with that now safely in the bag that sense of urgency has largely subsided katar paid the likes of zenine zidan and then Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola millions of dollars for endorsements in the buildup to their 2022 World Cup bid and most famously David Beckham received a reported $180 million to become the country's Ambassador for the next 10 years ahead of the tournament with a a particular focus on the World Cup which needed all of the promotion and good press that it could get its hands on following FIFA's corruption Scandal and numerous exposes on the treatment and conditions of Migrant workers not this migrant worker his paying conditions were excellent these ones not so much Saudi Arabia felt they could kill two government critics with one executioner sword to coin an old phrase by bringing players to the Saudi pro league with either an explicit agreement to promote the country's host credentials and the future tournaments or merely an implied one you don't have to be detective PUO to figure out that was the case when basically every bigname Saudi pro league signing had a carefully choreographed promo message scheduled to be uploaded within minutes of Saudi Arabia announcing their official bid to the 2034 World Cup my particular favorite came courtesy of Karen benzar who is rumored to be being paid 20 million a year to promote Saudi Arabia's prospective World Cup on top of his 100 million euro year playing contract Who quote tweeted the Saudi football federation's announcement and wrote and when I say he wrote I am really stretching the meaning of those words to breaking point quote wow amazing news the future is bright congrats to all my friends and fans in Saudi Arabia on this big announcement I know how much you love the game and what this would mean to you if would be an incredible FIFA World Cup # Saudi 2034 end quote what a heartfelt and touching message from someone who just earnestly wants Saudi Arabia to host the World Cup it has been a lifelong ambition of his to make it happen the 20 million a year is just a bonus the real motivation is because he knows how much they love the game didn't you hear them man I especially enjoyed the opening wow amazing amazing news as if it has come as a great shock to him that the country paying his wages plus 20 million EUR a year to promote their World Cup has bid to host the World Cup wow amazing news whoever could have foreseen such a shocking turn of events that is enough dunking on benzar for now at least mahrez and Gerard's tweets or Instagram posts were no less embarrassing old Stevie went with and again I use those words Loosely incredible to think that the 11year journey to a home FIFA World Cup might have already started for some of my youth players hard work Starts Now clapping emoi Saudi Arabia flag # Saudi 20034 end quote you can tell that those weren't Gerard's own words because at no point did he say yeah of course three out of 10 must try harder the point being however that Saudi Arabia has got their World Cup now and they have got it unopposed unlike their initial 203 30 World Cup bid as one of three co-hosts by dropping their bid to co-host in 2030 which they should never really have been eligible to do under FIFA rules but we will just skip over that for now FIFA gave Saudi Arabia a clear run at hosting in 20134 on their own effectively rigging the process so no one else could challenge them and making it fairly clear that it would be pointless to do so anyway because FIFA had already made their decision I can buy that having bought the right to house the World Cup un opposed the sense of urgency among Muhammad bin Salman and his inner circle to sign part players part ambassadors on exorbitant salaries may have somewhat waned after all they've got all the paid up ambassadors recruited over the last 12 months so what's the rush to add anymore with the World Cup already in the bag and over 10 years into the future the fact that Saudi Arabia's World Cup is over 10 years away however also surely adds a desire to make the Saudi pro league project a long-term one over the next 10 years Saudi Arabia is going to have to build 10 state of the arw football stadiums all with capacities in excess of 40,000 and at least some over 60 and 80,000 as well as renovating a further four to bring them up to FIFA requirements in order to give them 14 venues capable of Hosting games at a FIFA World Cup following the catar Fiasco and the persistent problem of World Cup venues becoming white elephants once the monthlong show leaves town FIFA mandated that host Nations must have at least seven existing suitable stadiums and could only build a further seven those rules were very quietly changed very conveniently for Saudi Arabia with that requirement falling from seven to four existing stadiums to seamlessly pave the way for a successful Saudi bid Saudi Arabia isn't a micro State like Qatar though while qatar's bogus proposals to repurpose or donate parts or whole stadiums as we recently covered on this channel in some depth have yet to and seem unlikely to have a substantively come true Saudi Arabia is a nation of around 36 million people over half of whom are under the age of 25 I think this is really the Crux of why Saudi Arabia has invested so much money in football at least as much as it has to do with cleansing the nation's image overseas or sportswashing establishing it as a region superpower and a global midsize power and as MBS recently claimed increasing GDP by between 1 to 2% young people particularly young men and especially when you have a growing educated population and a disenfranchised Elite who are excluded from the halls of power is the most significant determinant of the likelihood of Revolution and the toppling of regimes Saudi Arabia sits almost perfectly in that sweet spot in terms of demog graphics for revolution which is why the house of sa has always been terrified by revolutions on its doorstep whether that be in Egypt Yemen or most notably Iran Saudi Arabia's investment in not just football but a whole raft of sports football just being the most significant and expensive of them is almost certainly motivated at least in part by a desire to quell this quiet and dissatisfaction among the country's young male population in addition to encourag in them to become more active as Saudi Arabia has a big problem with teenage and young adult obesity and other health related issues I've covered all of this in much more detail in a previous Saudi Arabia video but of course it is relevant when asking why spending is slowed down to consider why it began in the first place and to assess the long-term viability of the overall project I think that it's unlikely therefore that Saudi Arabia will abandon or abort their football project to to the same extent as China did between 2019 and 2021 just 5 years after it began or at least that they will do so before hosting the 2034 World Cup which will almost certainly cost in excess of100 billion again this is a point that I have made in the past but there is this perception that Saudi Arabia is the richest country known to man and has endless resources in reality it has a GDP of a little over $800 billion Which is less than half the size of Australia's GDP a country with 10 million fewer people and therefore almost three times the GDP per capita katar spent an estimated $220 billion hosting the 2022 World Cup when all related infrastructure transport projects and bribes are taken into account that is almost exactly the same as Saudi Arabia's total annual oil export Sports $224 billion upon which the country is practically entirely dependent the 2034 World Cup will be on a much larger scale due to the increased tournament size in format meaning that Saudi Arabia will have to build six more stadiums than Qatar and the cost May well be even greater for them even if we say that it will only cost the same it seems impr probable that the house of sa would allocate that degree of funds to hosting a month-long football tournament with without having a long-term strategy in place for the sport of course it is possible that long-term strategy May well just inail more moderation than Saudi Arabia's initial investments in football I mean it could hardly entail any less and that even at this stage Saudi Arabia could already be contemplating a change of tact it's no secret that attendances in the Saudi pro league haven't risen as hoped following the arrival of so many bigname players for such exorbitant fees which is a problem when one of your primary motives is to engage young people or even just from an economic standpoint there are lots of reasons for those low attendances from the disparity and levels of support for big and small teams and the culture that exists around attending games through to poor infrastructure and extreme heat as I covered in an entire video dedicated to that exact topic but whatever the cause it is an issue likewise Global interest in the league has been at best underwhelming Saudi Arabia has had great success in bringing eyeballs to the country in a way that it can manipulate and gaining instant results in sports like boxing MMA Formula 1 and golf football isn't like other sports though most of the people who would pay to watch Anthony Joshua fight Tyson Fury in London will still pay to watch Anthony Joshua fight Tyson Fury and Riad most of the people who would watch Gabrielle Martinelli and de kulvi in London namely Arsenal and Spurs fans but also football and Premier League fans more broadly won't still watch Gabriel Martinelli and Dean kulesi if they join Al hillal and al- Nasser and start playing in Riad instead football just doesn't work like that fans are attached to clubs more so than players there is a whole ecosystem within which teams and leagues exist and the sport is so popular and has such deep attachment to so many people throughout the world that it is impossible to ever concentrate it in a single destination or on a single competition as the Saudis have been able to do in a sport like golf in short the Saudis have spent an awful lot of money on football and they have so far got very little in return so it would hardly be shocking if they were re-evaluating their strategy and their options and were therefore a little bit more reserved and apprehensive in the January transfer window the focus on hosting tournaments whether that be the AFC champions league Elite the FIFA Club World Cup or the domestic super cup of literally any football association in need of a bit of cash hasn't wavered at all along with Saudi Arabia's more fruitful investment in other sports and indeed the Premier League club Newcastle United the elephant in the room here is that the lack of arrivals to the Saudi pro league in the January window wasn't entirely the decision of Saudi pro league clubs themselves in several instances is it would appear that there was substantive interest in players and even bids accepted which progressed to personal terms being discussed only for the players in question to turn the opportunity down alad for example reportedly had A3 million euro bid for Argentina under 20 International Matia sule accepted by Juventus alad hopes that the opportunity to play Under Argentina Legend Marcela Gallardo who manages the club would be enough to clinch the deal along with with an enormous salary which genuinely would have been lifechanging at this stage for the 20-year-old sule turned it down though choosing to see out the rest of what has so far been an outstanding loone spell at froston wanting to focus on his development and realize his ambition in football first and foremost sole isn't alone Nabil F hakan shalan Ogo and Anthony martial were all reportedly offered and turned down approaches from Saudi clubs in the January window meanwhile Jo Mourinho was apparently offered the al-shabab job after getting sacked at Roma but also said no it's no secret that there is a discontent among some of the players who have already moved to Saudi Arabia and footballers talk to one another if you're 50/50 about making such a radical career and life decision and a former teammate who has gone out there sews a few seeds of doubt in your mind that is probably likely to swing your decision against the move Jordan Henderson is obviously the most well documented case as the first really high-profile and enormously well-paid player to of prematurely call time upon his stint in Saudi Arabia but he's not alone in having caught cold feet former Celtic star and treble winner jota has perhaps had the most unfortunate time of all almost as soon as he arrived at alad for a club record £25 million it seemed as though he was out in the cold left out of the squad to make room for other foreign players there were room that his compatriot and head coach Nuno esparito Santo never wanted to sign him and the Fiasco surrounding jot is just one of a series of crises of the circus that has been ality had this season despite signing the likes of kante fabinho and bondor winner Karen benzar in the summer as one of the big four pfm teams adding them to a team that literally won the Saudi pro league last season Aly had currently find themselves down in seventh in the table below Dam back a club who averaged fewer than 5,000 fans at their home game so far this season jot unsurprisingly wanted out then having only played 133 minutes of football in the Saudi Pro legal season and look set for a deadline day move to West Ham at the final minute though Aly had boss Marcela Gallardo who replaced Nuno esparito sansu in November changed his mind decided to register jota and pulled the plug on the deal benzar himself one of the League's Mary signings has had his issues in Saudi Arabia as well he was reported not to have got on with Nuno esparito Santo and despite making 17 goal contributions in 20 games since arriving from Real Madrid benzar has been criticized by locals for his performances which it has been speculated is the reason why he both deleted his Instagram accounts and didn't show up to midseason training it's no secret that benzar was keen on returning to Europe during the January window and has been unhappy with this start her life at alad though he was linked with the likes of Arsenal and Chelsea benzar was reportedly told that he could only move internally to another Saudi club so he chose to stay put elsewhere Roberto firmino has been dropped at Al Ali despite being Club captain and was reportedly keen on a January exit firmino's agent reportedly touted his services to Chelsea Fulham and perhaps somewhat ambitiously Real Madrid with the firmest interest ultimately coming from Che F United but Al Ali refused to entertain any offers and forino didn't choose to force their hand aerport told Spanish newspaper as quote they have not made it easy for us in fact there are many players that are discontented we are working on it every day negotiating so to speak and to see if it improves a little because this is something new for them too having European players who already have a long career maybe they are not used to this and have to adapt to a little more seriousness adding in terms of quality of life I expected something different because in the end here you spend 3 hours a day in the car Riad is a waste of traffic of time wasted in the car end quote when leap's comments were shared on social media he responded with a cross Emoji suggesting either that he felt they weren't fully reflective of what he had said or had been taken out of context or that the league had caught wind of them and are told him to issue some kind of a retraction it is hard to come out and say actually I was lying I've never been stuck in traffic in Riad which is presumably while aort just issued a Crossing response of course Saudi Arabia is one of the strictest most repressive conservative and authoritarian countries in the world it is hardly surprising that players moving there from Spain England and France and particularly those who have only ever lived in relatively free Western countries should find it a little bit difficult to adapt you're probably thinking of the prohibition on alcohol or the strict rules relating to women's dress when I say something like that but the biggest hurdle for foreign footballers in Saudi Arabia has in fact been the country's restrictions on living arrangements it is a crime in Saudi Arabia for unmarried couples to live together or for women to get pregnant or have children outside of marriage and there are no exceptions for foreigners on work visas well except for one exception it would seem Cristiano Ronaldo and his partner Georgina Rodriguez aren't married they have five children two from Georgina and three from Ronaldo's previous relationships and through surrogacy and they live together in Riyad of course that should see them arrested and thrown in jail but it has been widely reported that as part of his record-breaking move of the Kingdom Ronaldo and Rodriguez were seeming Exempted from a law that applies to everyone else that has caused some tension among unmarried Saudi pro league players who are also in relationships whose Partners have instead in some instances it is reported chosen to live in Dubai alongside the players in question who only spend time in Saudi Arabia for matches and training an even more radical solution adopted by former Liverpool Captain Steven Gerard and previously Jordan Henderson before his early departure is just to live in an entirely different country and only commute into Saudi Arabia Gerard and previously Henderson had made home in Manama the capital of Bahrain a small island Kingdom connected to Saudi Arabia by the king F corway or alternatively by a short helicopter ride Bakin has much more relaxed laws relating to things like alcohol co- inhabitation and civil liberties providing less of a culture shock to Western players there children attend local British schools there is the local Bakin Rugby Club with a clubhouse which serves alcohol and plenty of high-end restaurants inside of hotels like the Ritz Carlton and the Four Seasons there has been no official comment from the Saudi government or Saudi pro league officials as to these living arrangements but it's not exactly a great look is it if you're investing billions in sports and signing some of the biggest names in World football on literally the biggest contract tracks in the entire history of the sport at least in part as a propaganda exercise to promote your country's image and its reputation for trade and tourism what kind of message does it send when people who the government is paying tens of millions of pounds refuse to even live there it's a bit of a PR own goal which is probably why no players have gone public about it at least Beyond vaguely alluding to it it's also perhaps why Cristiano Ronaldo who appears to quite literally be above the LW in Saudi Arabia as though he were now actually a member of the ruling House of Saud has become the League's biggest cheerleader claiming that life in Riyad and the region is incredible and that the standard of football in the Saudi pro league is better than the standard in League g a comment which if you looked very closely you could actually see his nose gross lately when he said It In fairness Ronaldo he might have meant League one the third tier of English football though even there you don't get crowds of just a few hundred others meanwhile who have been afforded fewer privileges beyond the headline wages have been a little bit more reserved Ronaldo incidentally before moving into a mansion in Riad lived at the Four Seasons Hotel I say incidentally there because I once stayed at a Four Seasons Hotel in Cyprus I didn't pay for it of course where one floor of the hotel had been entirely booked out by a Saudi Prince and member of the House of Saud which was visible from my balcony on the floor above I feel well placed therefore to speak to the fact that the form of salafism and wahhabism promoted by Saudi Arabia and the strict form of sharia implemented by the state isn't necessarily aded to by all of the nation's rulers make no mistake rules for thee but not for me as an adage is far from exclusive to Saudi Elites in fact I would say that it's the norm almost everywhere in the world but it that little bit more pointed and warped when some of those supposed misdeeds that you're guilty of can result in your own citizens quite literally being beheaded you know it was bad when Boris Johnson parted through lockdown with impunity while students got £10,000 fines for doing the exact same thing really bad but I think we can all agree that it would have been even worse if those same students had instead been executed former Chelsea director of football Under Roman Abramovic Michael Lalo who is now the sports director of the entire Saudi pro league has dismissed the idea that any players are unhappy with the standard of football training or their living conditions and the culture shock in Saudi Arabia implying that it is a narrative being spun by people trying to undermine the league of course in some instances we know that isn't true em andalo also claimed for example that Jordan Henderson was happy at alac and had no intention whatsoever of leaving Saudi Arabia before his contract expired about 3 weeks before Henderson left Ali fact to join Ajax that's not to say that everyone's in the same boat there have only really been substantive reports about maybe six or seven players being genuinely unhappy in Saudi Arabia and seeking moves elsewhere and though laort spoke of wide spread discontent it is unclear how many players he actually spoke on behalf of out of almost 150 foreign players You could argue that's not all that bad if we are to assume that those who haven't spoken out or voiced any grievances publicly don't have any whatsoever I think that it is unlikely that the Saudi pro league will collapse with the same ferocity and speed as the Chinese Super League did three or four years ago for a start though far from outstanding the Saudi national team is stronger than China's and the country's domestic player pool is able to prop up the league as a sort of Third Rate Global league on their own in a way that China's wasn't that perhaps is also a reason why Saudi Arabia are reluctant to slash all restrictions on the number of foreign players in the league in an attempt to safeguard domestic development and the future prospects of the national team now managed by Roberto manini and also in a bit of a crisis after manini exiled three of the national team star players before KSA were dunked out of the Asian cup in the round of 16 stage but that is a whole other the Meltdown for a whole other occasion it is more likely I think that Saudi Arabia is assessing its options the country has been successful in buying a World Cup something that China never managed but less successful in increasing crowds television audiences and hoovering up market share as they have been able to do much more easily and effectively in other less popular sports there are numerous hurdles which although Saudi Arabia may be very gradually liberalizing many foreign players are always likely to find it difficult to adjust to though it is hard to know what they expected just sort of Googling Saudi Arabia laws perhaps would have been a good start or maybe they just assumed that the Ronaldo exemptions would apply to them all anyhow that is my long rambling Saudi Arabia update I hope that it is the last one for a while but the number of requests reached a Breaking Point and left me with

players, including attempts to sign Liverpool's Muhammad Salah during the summer transfer window. Despite offering record-breaking fees and wages, Saudi clubs faced challenges due to foreign player quotas and financial unsustainability. The league's January window was quieter, partly due to failure to sign targeted players like Lionel Messi, and also because players like Jordan Henderson and Karim Benzema expressed dissatisfaction. This disappointment was echoed by other individuals who found living conditions and cultural restrictions difficult to adapt to. Moreover, the Saudi Pro League faces low attendance and global interest despite heavy investments, while domestic clubs grapple with the challenge of dealing with high-wage contracts, making it hard to offload players. The transcript suggests that Saudi Arabia's motives include not just global sporting influence but also social stability by engaging the youth. The document also notes potential long-term plans linked to the 2034 World Cup, indicating that Saudi's sportswashing efforts might face both internal and external obstacles.",Sportswashing,-1,No,Saudi Pro League,Saudi Arabia
hhDaKszN-zA,What Is ACTUALLY Going On In Saudi Arabia?,"it's been about a year since the Saudi Arabia project started gaining major attaction the most popular person in the world or rather the most popular person on Instagram same thing really Cristiano Ronaldo packed his bags and went off to Saudi for money that was literally unheard of at the time hundreds of millions per season that is a lot of FIFA points the reactions to this were mixed on a financial level it was a mixture of the wealth of athletes as a grotesque consequence of capitalism and go on get your bag Ronnie on a sporting level there was a mixture of this league is a joke nowhere near the levels that this guy should be playing at and this league isn't really that bad plus this is a great way to grow its profile no harm done on a political level saying it was controversial is an understatement Ronaldo wasn't the only big name that made the switch eight and nine figure deals for two seasons of football where's the way of dozens of footballers we all know too well and just as many were rejected too one year on and what do we know now well it seems that this ambitious project isn't exactly going according to plan over the past few weeks news leaks and rumors have been coming out of Saudi Arabia pertaining to quite a few high-profile players most of them negative Jordan Henderson has apparently accomplished his mission of growing the game inside Arabia and wants to head back to Europe Karen benma doesn't feel like he needs to go to training Turkish super Cup games are being played in Saudi Arabia now or rather not being played Neymar is well nothing new from Neymar really it's easy to think that we're seeing the demise of the Saudi league but I don't know if that's the case in fact I don't think that's the case after all transfer Windows always SP rumors what's actually going on what's going on everyone hope you're all doing well I'm Tasha welcome back to the channel feel free to subscribe if you haven't so you will be a great help but no stress for some reason it seems like all the major players that went over to Saudi Arabia are starting to regret their decisions which is a bit of an odd one however something that I know you guys will never regret is downloading sofa score using the link in the description if you need a free football app for all detailed stats news and odds go ahead and use that link in the description you won't regret it anyway before we get started on this one I just want to preface a few things it's very hard for us to tell what is actually going on in Saudi Arabia not just from a footbowling perspective a good example of this is Roberto manini Saudi Arabian national team coach just the other day he excluded three important Saudi players from the Asia Cup squads he says it's because they are not committed to the team they say he is lying who's telling the truth apart from that when doing the research for this video it was really difficult to come across a media outlet that was unbiased and wasn't creating pieces that were you know fueled by aemotion agenda or biases for or against the project it's it's a bit of a touchy subject hard to really approach and and one thing I will say is that it's not that hard to be critical of something without spreading hate just some food for thought I guess having said all of that the Saudi pro league has been on the radar as one that most Pros should avoid for years now and these these aren't my words in 2022 Thief Pro listed Saudi Arabia as one of seven countries that players were advised against moving to in case you're unaware thev Pro is essentially a global trade Union for professional footballers meaning that this data is sourced from actual practicing Pro footballers around the world not journalists with agendas the reasoning for advising against moving there was amongst other factors frequent nonpayment of salaries injured players or quietly sideline players have simply been left unpaid for reasons unknown to the players themselves despite holding binding contracts over $16 million us has been paid to players by Saudi clubs in 2023 alone after FIFA had to step in and mediate over such cases obviously this isn't reflective of all cases but it does go to show that there is a whole other side to prolife outside of the mega signings that have been flooding our timelines anyway let's really start this discussion off with Jordan Henderson it's an interesting case at the end of LA season it was apparent that Jordan Henderson was no longer the player that Liverpool needed him to be to get back to the levels that they really should be at him the corpse of fabinho and javey Elliot were the usual Midfield three apparently Thiago and Arthur were also there but there is no evidence he had 2 years left on his contract where he was apparently earning a base of just over 150,000 per week depending on who you believe so he was doing quite all right financially but it was clear that he would play a smaller role going forward klopp wanted him to stay though he was the captain a large presence for Liverpool Football club and I would say a highly respected footballer in the global Community who wouldn't want him to stay Jordan Henderson Jordan Henderson wouldn't want him to stay Henderson was a vocal supporter of lgbtq plus rights and was not shy of voicing his opinion for several other public matches when off the pitch he was maybe the most focal of the Premier League captains who wore rainbow colored armbands and laces during stonewall's campaign in 2020 3 years later he's joined a club from a country where homosexuality is illegal all it took was £700,000 per week apparently it's a strange story it really is but Henderson insisted that him being in Saudi Arabia was a positive thing who knows maybe he initially wanted to go there to change perceptions I don't know 6 months later it seems he's had enough lots of noise in the media these days about him wanting out and seriously wanting out perhaps it's the 75-minute commute he has to make to get from his house and Bahrain to the AL eifac training ground perhaps it's the heat averaging out at a dry 35° in the summer perhaps it's the fact that his team plays in front of 2,000 people at times and sits in ninth with the Euros coming up I'm pretty sure he might see that as a problem then again he's kind of like Harry MaGuire waste coat man will never not pick his guy so there's that whatever the reason is it seems that he wants out so bad that he's willing to go through whatever the tax implications are for breaking his contract TRG so soon now I am a trained accountant but I'm going to refer you guys to this athletic article that I came across to better explain the situation Steven Gerard is the manager of Al eifac things haven't been going according to plan for him as previously said you know ninth in the table no plans for him to leave have hit the news but perhaps it seems that betting the future on him wasn't the best idea for this club Roberto forino hasn't been playing much football for Al Ashley and is said to one up because of that Karen Benzema who was Adam meant about joining the pro league because Saudi Arabia is a Muslim country appears to have done a 180 himself he deleted his Instagram in late December a lot of people feel that this is due to the backlash he's been getting for a series of poor performances a theory which I find quite difficult to believe because let's not forget that this man played over 10 Seasons at Real Madrid you know many of which where he wasn't well liked by the fans especially early on Also let's also not forget that these fans were booing Ronaldo at the peak of his career so is that he failed to report to training on a number of occasions and has been left out of the club's midseason training plans looks like he might be on the Move please please Manchester United do not do this there's been no outright negativity surrounding Sadi ommani and him wanting to leave or anything like that however he has been in the news lately himself for oh moving along I briefly mentioned Roberto manini too he's been catching ing a lot of flack himself he left the Italy job to become the manager of the Saudi Arabia national team there's been a lot of hype about the future of the Saudi Arabian national team since their insane win against Argentina in the 2022 World Cup they obviously were aiming to build on that things haven't been going so great for him so far with around four wins in about nine matches he could be doing better now like a lot of the people that went over to Saudi Arabia a lot of them have been very insistent or persistent rather about the fact that they went there to grow the game and for opportunity and all of that and that was never about money in the case of manini we're talking about 25 million EUR per anom off tax apparently I would dare 100 people to say no to a contract like that I think few very few would turn it down manini's own son said this about his father's move to Saudi Arabia it would be presumptuous to assume he speaks for about manini but it's not the best look you know at the same time in the event that he does speak for his father I respect it it's an insane bag just be honest about your intentions nobody would care about Jordan Henderson going over to Saudi if he simply said listen I'm 33 years old if I play on Mery side I'm going to be a bench player until I retire I'm going for that lost paycheck people would have been up in arms initially especially with regards to the hypocrisy however I think most of us at the end of the day would just say the same thing fair enough from our perspective all this seems really bad doesn't it according to all the news Outlet Saudi Arabia is too hot the league is too uncompetitive which I mean it kind of has to be right you know we have to believe that part at least there's a reason why no young players are going there yet the culture is too restrictive which I also don't really believe I think if you're Mega Rich anywhere it's kind of a case of rules for the and not for me so by all of that logic when we hear news about Benzema firmino Henderson and more complaining anyone that was already against the Saudi project is in full I Told You So mood now at the same time Cristiano Ronaldo will tell you that the league will be a top five league in the world eventually engolo kante will tell you that the level in the league is comparable to League ear in terms of quality which is fair enough however he only played one season in Liga and 10 years ago to be fair he'd know more than I would anyway player grievances isn't really something that I would say we can use as an indicator for the league going down the dumps I think we can just chalk that down to disgruntled employees Ronaldo is the highest scoring player in the world Ruben Nas is doing well Alexander mitovich s m Riad MZ sedge milinkovic Savage Anderson TSA no complaints from them there is more to it than that I think a better case for actual public sentiment when it comes to Saudi Arabia's growing presence in the sporting world can be seen when looking at the international events hosting if you were to ask the Crown Prince about what he thinks when it comes to the ongoing media Fiasco around the Saudi League Sports washing and everything in between he'll say if sportswashing is going to increase my gross domestic product by 1% then we'll continue to do sportswashing I don't care I have 1% growth in GDP and I am aiming for another 1.5% these were his actual words he's unbothered with the accusations the increase in hosting of international events is only ramping up it seems Tyson Fury and Francis nanu had their high-profile fight and Riad back in October of 2023 Anthony Joshua made Otto Wallen look ordinary in late December Joshua versus ganu is going to go down in Riad in March this fight will be insane the third season of live golf is set to commence in February in October of 2023 as per the Saudi Arabian fa the kingdom has hosted over 50 high-profile international events since 2018 including but not limited to football Motorsports tennis equestrian Esports and golf and they're only getting started an increase in the number of high-profile sporting events stretches to football as well we've had the Spanish super cup as well as the club World Cup both held in the country over the past month or so there has been an increased sense that Saudi Arabia will host a World Cup within the next 10 years and in my eyes it's already been decided it just hasn't been announced there's also a feeling that the Saudi Arabian fa will make a push to join the Champions League at some point no no not not the Asian champions League where Saudi teams already competing the UEFA Champions League traditionally reserved for European teams but who knows really these guys are willing to do a lot to add more games what we do know is that if recent history has anything to go by going forward a lot of these events are going to be met with resistance the 2023 turer super cup was scheduled to be held on the 29th of December 2023 in Saudi Arabia it's worth noting that this is not the first of its kind to be held outside of Turkey as recently as 2021 the final was held in Doha the official reasoning for having this one during the winter break instead of in August as per usual was that both teams have a congested fixture schedule in October Saudi Arabia was chosen as the final venue bad idea 2023 was a very important year for the entirety of turkey it was in 1923 that turkey established its governance structure as a republic 100 years later and celebrations were needed preferably in Turkey people were not happy about this however the Turkish fa didn't really seem to care they were quick to point out to the public that they should just calm down it's not that big of a deal plus everyone's doing it the Spaniards and the Italians were all following suit holding their Cup finals in Saudi the cup of the century the cup of the Republic was said to be held outside of turkey nothing could go wrong here right now both teams wanted to at least warm up in custom shirts that featured Mustafa kimal atat the Founding Father of the Republic of turkey and also display Flags showing some well-known quotes of his however this was denied by local Saudi authorities that along with an insistence by the Saudi authorities to play the Saudi Arabian national team I guess robbed both teams the wrong way and really left them with one viable option in their minds they refused to play the match was cancelled and they returned to Turkey as Heroes the location and date of the rescheduled match is yet to be enough Ed Real Madrid took on Atletico Madrid in the semi-final of the Spanish super Cup on the 10th of Jan 2024 a Madrid Derby being held in Saudi Arabia is wild as it is but the start of this match had a lot more to it than that legend of the game France beckenbauer sadly passed on at the age of 78 on the 7th of January 2024 a minute of Silence was supposed to be observed in honor of the great man instead the moment of silence was met with booze by the fans in attendance absolutely zero fans of Saudi Arabia were made in Germany or Europe that day the official reasoning for this is unknown however there' have been a lot of theories that have been making the rounds one of the theories was that the booze were aimed at Tony Kos and Tony Cross alone he's a man that's been highly critical of the Saudi League he was of course playing that day for Real Madrid he was booed loudly whenever received the ball another reason that's been doing the rounds is that it's simply not customary to observe moments of Silence in Saudi Arabia I don't know if that's true or not whatever the reasoning is I kind of struggle to think of any sort of scenario where you might think it's okay to boo a moment of respect you know just a showing of respect for one of the greatest and most prominent figures in the history of the sport or just the passing of a life in general it seems like the most avoidable controversy ever doesn't it football in Saudi Arabia is growing in prominence now it is a football crazy Nation it always has been however it's been crazy for international football now being able to to see the best Stars the stars that people grew up watching in Europe playing in their own backyards is insane but it's only part of the plan the plan is to increase the footprint of all sports in the country and who's to say that this goal is under Jeopardy a handful of disillusioned stars and their agents unlikely as long as the money is still there I'm pretty sure the traffic is going to keep on rolling towards Saudi Arabia I said this in the last video I made on Saudi Arabia and I'll say it again in my eyes if you're a higher up agu wafer or a higher up for any of the boards in European clubs any of the bigger clubs being afraid of the potential of Saudi Arabia going forward in football is the correct response not just because they have lured the best players recently it was announced that there will be a relaxing of the regulations regarding the number of foreign players that are allowed in a proleague football team now it's worth noting that this is only for state owned teams currently the Restriction sits at eight players and will be lifted up to 10 players at the start of of next season rumor has it that a lot of the teams are going to be looking to fill up those extra two spots with youngsters from Europe South America and Africa where do most Europeans get their most talented youngsters South America why do they go off to Europe money imagine if a Saudi Arabian team offered to pay all of messy's medical bills early on and set up his family for life now I'm not saying he would have gone over there for sure but he would have thought about it as long as they have the money players will keep keep going there and there isn't much anyone can do about it it's a funny sentiment really one that several people around Europe have felt towards the Premier League and one that several people around the world have long felt about Europe some food for thought and there we have it let me know what you guys think about the craziness going on in Saudi Arabia and all that it's been a crazy past 6 months and I think as we head into the euros and Beyond it'll just keep ramping up yeah anyway feel free to subscribe feel free to follow all the socials that's all for me today hope you guys enjoyed hope you're having a great day cheers and I will catch you in the next [Music] one","The transcript discusses the phenomena surrounding Saudi Arabia's expanding influence in global football, primarily through high-profile player transfers and hosting significant sports events. Noteworthy is Cristiano Ronaldo's move to the Saudi league on a lucrative contract, which stirred varied reactions. Initially perceived as a strategic move to boost the league’s profile, issues such as player regrets and operational missteps began surfacing, bringing the project's success into question. Various reports suggest notable players like Jordan Henderson and Karim Benzema expressing discontent, desiring returns to Europe. Criticisms include frequent non-payment issues and cultural and sporting challenges in the Saudi Pro League. Additionally, there's a political undertone, addressing sportswashing, specially attributed to statements by Saudi leaders who prioritize economic benefits over criticism. The narrative further explores larger implications, including Saudi Arabia's ambition to host a FIFA World Cup and integrate more deeply into European football ecosystems. In this space, sportswashing accusations give way to the strategic expansion of Saudi influence through financial investment in sports. Despite some setbacks, as demonstrated by unrest in the Turkish Super Cup and adverse reactions during the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia's plans appear unapologetically ambitious, with economic and geopolitical implications. The discussion also acknowledges acknowledgment of fan bases and regulatory relaxations facilitating the growth of the local league, reiterating the unyielding influence of financial power in sports.",Sportswashing,-1,No,Saudi Pro League,Saudi Arabia
wvEw-ozrZNU,The Saudi Pro League Explained,foreign Benzema has signed for Saudi pro league team aletihad a simple statement in a summer transfer window and one that on the face of it has all the Hallmarks of an aging European star simply leaving the continent for one final payday but the reality is that this and the other big name Acquisitions that are about to follow him into the country actually Mark a serious power shift within the global footballing market one that whether people like it or not is specifically designed to change the sport Forever This is how Saudi Arabia is secretly conquering football on November 22nd last year the Saudi Arabian national team came from a goal behind to beat the eventual world champions Argentina it was unarguably one of the most shocking results in the entire history of the world cup and under normal circumstances would have represented the biggest thing to happen to Saudi football for a generation however it held that status for barely six weeks a mere 48 days later Cristiano Ronaldo tore up his contract at Manchester United and was unveiled as the newest signing for Saudi club al-nasa he did so though to an online course of laughs and derision here was one of the game's best players still thinking himself an elite athlete going to play in the 68th biggest league in the world but as we will see this summer Ronaldo was merely the first major name in what's designed to be an explosive and disruptive period of growth for football in Saudi Arabia one that's now financed by the country's own Sovereign wealth fund and could thus start to challenge the top leagues in Europe almost immediately Ronaldo is already there Benzema the reigning ballon door holder is now set to join him but this is only the beginning Chelsea's Angolo kante has also reportedly signed a deal within the league Wilfred zahar looks to believe in Crystal Palace and has a Saudi offer on the table Roberto firmino and Sergio busquets free agents after leaving Liverpool and Barcelona respectively have allegedly been approached Luka Modric Pepe and Sergio Ramos of all hell talks on joining former teammate Ronaldo Neymar's Representatives have spoken to a number of clubs in the league song young Min and ilk gundawan apparently both consider it a viable option if their next move can't guarantee them Champions League football and the list just goes on and on and on despite the European season having barely finished and then there's Lionel Messi still regarded as the greatest player in the world by some and forever considered the greatest player who ever lived by many the Argentinian isn't just already in bed with Saudi Arabia he's firmly under the covers counting his money with a torch signed by the nation's Sovereign wealth fund to be a global Ambassador for the country itself Messi's relationship with both the management and fans of Paris Saint-Germain reached the point of no return over a trip he made to the country failing to seek permission from his manager and in the wake of an embarrassing home defeat his social media was flooded with carefully choreographed holiday snaps in Riyadh while he was supposed to be at training and if you're wondering how a player with his alleged dedication and professionalism thought this was somehow okay then keep in mind that whatever ass astronomical sum of money he was receiving from his Club was dwarfed by the one he was receiving from his hosts he took that trip because it would have been financially stupid not to the same logic they were hoping would apply to him this very summer with an alleged 1.9 billion dollar contract offered to play his football there next season but despite missing out on Messi to MLS the Saudi pro league believe with good reason that they can be one of the top 10 biggest leagues in the world and a genuine attraction for the game's top players and managers all within the next few years and where we've seen this before with aging Superstars squeezing the last of their careers in MLS all players still in their Prime opting to take life-changing money from a move to the Chinese League this is very different it's on a whole other scale entirely and it's all because of how it's funded throughout the rest of the world football clubs are private Enterprises by and large they need to generate money in order to be able to spend it or else get lumbered with the sort of debt that ultimately sees things go very very wrong for them even in the U s where the teams are owned by the league MLS the last to generate the bulk of the money that goes into buying players or expanding clubs effectively keeping it all within its means but in May that all changed for the Saudi League when the division's big four aletiad al-nasa al-ali and al-hilal were all collectively taken over by the country's Sovereign wealth fund pif this means that they now have access to near Limitless financial resources and are already able to offer wages way in excess of all but the very top European clubs the idea being that by using the countries near bottomless pit of development money to bring in some of football's biggest names they immediately improve both the quality and the status of the League this of course creates a two-tier League of financial disparity between those four clubs and the rest of the division but there isn't a major league in the world where that hasn't just happened naturally but if the name pif rings a bell to you though then it should it's the state-owned Sovereign wealth fund that's been behind the Newcastle United takeover and more recently changed the entire face of golf Forever by merging its live Venture with that of the PGA and DP world tours it is not an organization that invests in something without Ambitions to dominate it huge Stakes have been acquired in Disney Starbucks WWE Uber and countless others as it works on its mission to diversify the country's portfolio away from just simply being an oil State and Rebrand Saudi Arabia's image on a world stage and this is where the controversy starts the Saudi Arabian human rights record should appall anyone who takes the time to learn about it homosexuality is considered a crime in the country and is punishable by deportation life imprisonment public flogging and even death women's rights while improving are still severely restricted and the country is listed as one of the worst in the world for its attitudes on civil liberty and freedom of speech in 2023 alone the country has already broken its record for the number of arrests made over political activism and descend towards the government while there is always an argument over how much relevance this should have to the sporting institutions its state-backed wealth fund Hazard tendrils in the difference here is that the obfuscation is largely the point Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 project is if you'll pardon the pun the jewel in the crown of Prince Mohammed bin Salman's modernization Revolution he wants to secure the country's future as a major player on the world stage by not only fostering enormous investment in a wide range of national Enterprises but by making it a popular tourist destination with visitors from the West to do both of these things it needs to fit in with European and American ideologies as well as routinely showcasing that it's culturally on a similar wavelength thus the country's greatest resource its wealth is pumped into Disney it's pumped into Starbucks it's pumped into golf it's pumped into WWE and it's pumped in increasing volumes into football investing in teams like Newcastle gives them a seat at both the Premier League and now the Champions League table sure but having a league that exported around the world because it's home to some of the biggest players is infinitely more valuable but the story here that often goes unreported is the local one Saudi Arabia has a booming population that is increasingly young affluent digitally and culturally switched on and that has a serious appetite for the entertainment it sees from the west but it's also one that as the spotlight on the nation is intensified is growing Bolder in voicing its disquiet over the obvious social disparities it sees between what rights they have and what the rest of the world enjoys this might sound incredibly oversimplified but investing billions into giving the country one of the best football leagues in the world where fans can see players like Ronaldo and Benzema every single week is in part design duplicates some of this discontent and just like hosting major WWE shows or a Formula One Grand Prix or opening a Six Flags amusement park it will to some extent work in purely footballing terms though it's also seen as being a major boost to the country's hopes of hosting one of the next World Cups the League's biggest Club Alice yard commands an average attendance of over 40 000 fans but the rest of the division regularly sees four figures through the gates despite having capacity for five Cristiano Ronaldo's arrival at al-nasa took their average attendance from around 7 000 to nearly twenty thousand and the hope is that by adding Global Talent throughout the league every other club can see something similar after the awards to Russia and Qatar FIFA will undoubtedly face major scrutiny over its next set of choices and Saudi Arabia elevating its own domestic League to the point of global legitimacy offset this enormously this combined with talk of a joint bid between Saudi Arabia Egypt and Greece not only gives FIFA a combined African Asian and European tournament that would be immensely appealing but increases Saudi relations and relevance in both of those territories from this to public perception to investment opportunities to a worldwide national Rebrand the value to Saudi Arabia of attracting these top players goes way in excess of the undeniably enormous sums of money they're going to be paying them and make no mistake that is money that will alter the transfer market in Europe irrevocably all of a sudden players entering their final years who clubs might be reluctant to offer big wages to suddenly have a possible Market that offers resale value emerging clubs can even Target sales of prize assets to the league as a way to circumvent their own ffp rules but while both the reality and the impact of this change will only be fully apparent in time one thing is already set in stone this is football's part in the biggest PR campaign in human history and it's one that will have both sporting and cultural repercussions across the planet whether you call it modernization or Sports washing or both this isn't a story that's simply going to go away and it's one that every football fan will ultimately have a stake in Saudi Investment will undeniably be good for the game will be told but whether that means it's good for football is a different question entirely,"The transcript discusses Saudi Arabia's ambitious plan to disrupt the global football market through significant investments by its Sovereign Wealth Fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF). Highlighting the high-profile signings of star players like Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, among others, this initiative is more than just acquiring aging players; it marks a strategic push to elevate the Saudi Pro League into one of the top global leagues. This change is financially backed by the PIF, allowing the league's top clubs access to substantial financial resources. The move parallels historical shifts seen with player moves to MLS and the Chinese League, yet Saudi's approach is on a much grander scale.",Sportswashing,-1,No,Saudi Pro League,Saudi Arabia

GUuDJIr3FUs,You're wrong about Saudi Arabia...,what if I were to tell you that despite not getting a sniff of the Champions League the Qatari takeover of PSG has been a resounding success and for exactly the same reason the Saudi pro league will also be a resounding success however this has nothing to do with football in fact it's far from it bear with me I can explain but in order to explain we first have to see it Through The Eyes of most people so let's go Saudi Arabia stumbled across oil in the 1930s and ever since then they have made billions of dollars per month primarily by exporting it so if they really wanted to become a footballing Powerhouse why are they investing in middle-aged European stars who remember life before smartphones and social media surely it would make more sense to spend these billions on academies hence setting themselves up for long-term growth in the footballing industry instead right didn't China try exactly the same strategy with the Chinese Super league and completely fail well hang on you see Saudi Arabia's true motives aren't quite what you think and believe it or not everything so far is going exactly to plan as many of you may know Saudi Arabia has gone on a bit of a spending spree in recent years specifically when it comes to sports related Ventures these include the acquisition of Newcastle United the murder of live golf with the PGA Tour hosting several prestigious bossing events and luring a new high-profile player to the Saudi pro league seemingly every day many will be quick to point out Sports washing which we'll cover in a little bit but the main reason for this sudden upturn in sports investment is much deeper than that Saudi Arabia stands at a crucial Crossroads a nation in danger heavily reliant on oil to fuel its economy a staggering 42 percent of its GDP and a jaw-dropping 84 of its export income stem from oil meanwhile on the other side of the globe the USA boasts the most Diversified economy in the world but why is this a problem well oil cannot and will not last forever as it stands Saudi Arabia is predicted to run out of oil by the year 2100 a mere 77 years away while that may seem distant there's an even greater and more imminent cause for concern reports from the energy transition Think Tank carbon tracker found that long before the 2100 expiry date Saudi Arabia will face a crippling 44 shortfall in government revenues the world is changing rapidly so much so that some say oil may not even be profitable by the year 2050. the culprit a sweeping Global Revolution towards renewable energy the rise of electronic vehicles and evolving energy policies further decreased the need for oil at all so long story short Saudi Arabia needs to establish new sources of income and fast the ticking Time Bomb of Saudi Arabia's oil reserves looms large once the oil runs dry Saudi Arabia risks losing relevance altogether but they have a plan Saudi Vision 2030 is a transformative road map launched by the Saudi government in April 2016. with seven key objectives including surprise surprise moving away from oil the vision aims to achieve significant economic and social change in the country by 2030 and they've chosen football as their Escape Routes but wait how does football relate to economic diversification to grasp the full picture we need to take a look into the unique world of the football economy in Saudi Arabia let me introduce you to the Saudi public investment fund which is a government-owned investment fund that manages and invests money on behalf of the whole country in June they announced the Takeover of the Kingdom's four biggest clubs and our Etihad so in other words these four clubs have been turned into companies all backed by the funds of the Saudi Arabian government itself as part of a 20-year deal the government's ambitious plan aims to revolutionize the Saudi pro league with one critical Focus transforming Saudi Arabia into a global hub for entertainment and tourism and what better way to do that than by bringing the most followed human on Instagram to your country indeed the government has taken a bold step unveiling an intricate plan for the acquisition of several high-profile players at least three top foreign players to be signed for each of the top four clubs and another eight to be distributed amongst the remaining 12 teams Yes you heard that right the government itself is investing in multiple teams across the League this is not a sincere effort to dominate football the goal is to provide westerners who usually have more Diversified sustainable economies with a reason to deal with Saudi Arabia Beyond oil and this is the exact reason why from the Qatari point of view the Takeover of PSG was a game changer with one eye on the upcoming 2022 World Cup hosted in Qatar the country strategically invested in PSG recognizing the club as a powerful platform to elevate their country's image and brand on the global stage PSG was a blank canvas at the time a young Club struggling to make waves in League but they had one thing above almost every Club in Europe their location Paris is known around the world by everyone even your mom knows Paris the investment not only redefined psg's trajectory but also forged a bond between the Qatari and French government earning admiration across the West in June 2011 PSG became qatar's prized possession having been acquired for 80 million euros 12 years as Zlatan Ibrahimovic kylian abapi Neymar Jr and Lionel Messi later and PSG is now worth 50 times more all despite underwhelming in the Champions League for the entirety of that time you see PSG is not a football club anymore it's a fashion icon a brand ever since Jordan's collaboration with PSG in 2018 PSG has been the cool Club in Europe you'll even catch American kids who say football is for girls in a PSG show their true aim was never to win the Champions League instead countries now look at Qatar and say hey you know what these guys have got something going on look at the names they've attracted and the companies they work with and the icing on the cake the greatest player of all time a PSG player lifting the World Cup in the home of the PSG owners but this begs the question haven't China tried something similar and completely failed well not exactly while many comparisons have been drawn between the Chinese super league and the Saudi pro league in recent months many people are failing to see the distinct differences here the CSL was essentially the government pushing businessmen to pursue football it was all part of a grand attempt to elevate the CSO established only in 2004 in a country where football doesn't even rank amongst the top three most popular sports the ambitious goal was to catapult the CSO above Europe's top five leagues they hooked up by attracting Stars they would Inspire the Youth of China to start playing all in an attempt to eventually host and win the World Cup by 2050. yet the dream began to unravel when the ruling Communist Party noticed a considerable amount of money flowing out of Chinese pockets and into the hands of Europeans leading them to swiftly impose several rules which stopped the progress of the league in its tracks the Saudi situation is a whole different war game it involves the government itself investing in these clubs via the pif Notch them incentivizing their businessmen to invest in clubs therefore if the Saudi League fails it becomes not just a problem for the league but a nationwide concern Saudi Arabia also has much deeper Pockets than China for this project and a much greater need to invest given the oil issue that we've already seen so don't expect to see the Saudi government pulling out anytime soon furthermore the choice of players perceived by the Chinese League didn't quite generate the same Buzz signing Oscar and Hulk isn't quite the same as signing Cristiano Ronaldo no this is the point where some would say ah Saudi are only investing in so many high-profile names because they're trying to sportswash wait what even is sportswashing sportswashing is the practice of using sports events or Investments to improve a country's image or to divert attention away from negative issues in other words people would look at Saudi Arabia and be like yeah they may have a bad human rights record but they've got Kareem Benzema so I don't care but have you guys noticed something ever since Saudi Arabia began to heavily invest in football even more attention has been drawn towards their issues if anything it's been a complete opposite of sports washing take aletifax announcement video for the signing of Jordan Henderson for example in which they appear to have grayed out the LGBT armband that he was wearing they're clearly not concerned about censoring their beliefs and as a result the comments are flooded with criticism in short the Saudi government isn't bothered by these allegations they're more than aware that football is the greatest show on Earth and by investing in it along with investments in other sports they aim to become the global hub for entertainment and tourism and this all comes back to the original problem diversifying from oil thank you foreign [Music],"The transcript discusses the strategic motives behind Saudi Arabia's recent investments in sports, particularly in football, drawing parallels to Qatar's approach with Paris Saint-Germain (PSG). The discussion highlights that Saudi Arabia, reliant heavily on oil income, is looking to diversify its economy due to the eventual depletion of oil reserves and global shifts towards renewable energy. To do this, the Saudi government is using sports, especially football, as a tool for economic diversification and as a platform to increase its global influence and brand. The Saudi Public Investment Fund's takeover of the top football clubs in the Saudi Pro League is seen as a step to transform the country into a global entertainment and tourism hub. The transcript contrasts these efforts with China's unsuccessful attempt to strengthen its football league, citing significant differences in strategy and execution. It points out that while sportswashing—a technique used to improve a country's image by investing in sports—is often identified as a motive, the Saudi government's prominence in attracting high-profile football players might have instead highlighted existing human rights concerns more prominently. Ultimately, the investments in football and other sports are framed as a move toward positioning Saudi Arabia beyond its oil-reliant economy in alignment with its Vision 2030 goals.",Sportswashing,0,No,Paris Saint-Germain ownership,Saudi Arabia
wtQ4K7zcPkw,The Saudi Pro League will NEVER become popular unless they change THIS | Growth analysis,"so we're at about the halfway point in the 2023 24 football calendar and the question must be asked has the Saudi Pro League's recruitment ruined football how much has it really affected you I don't know about you but it hasn't really reached me at all I could watch the matches on donon and Canada but aside from that I rarely ever see anything about it for all of the top names that agreed to a move to play in Saudi Arabia there are plenty that turned it down as well but for those that did make the move how has it affected the growth of the league has has it improved the popularity of the sport within Saudi Arabia as a whole have other teams benefit from The Surge of signings or are things relatively the same for them are when they play the big boys what's up guys and welcome to rabona TV well I haven't been speaking about the Saudi pro league on the channel I have been keeping a close eye on it and how the massive wave of signings from last summer has affected the league as a whole so in this video we'll look at how the Saudi pro league has grown in notoriety around the world what whether attendances are up in the country or unaffected and how that compares to other Asian leagues as well we're only about a year into this massive project now so everything in this video will be said with a it's still early though things may change over time ASX depending on how the public investment fund decides on where to throw the money and by the way checking in on adrianne's closet of Curiosities I really need to be consistent with the name here but today we are wearing the Gang International FC away kit of beauty I was wearing their home kit in a recent Barcelona video that I released but these guys play in the Singapore premier league and both the home and away are nice of which I got thanks to our friends at sanalo sangalo have a massive sale right now for example this kit so if you want to grab some official unique kits from around the world such as clubs from Laos Zimbabwe India and more just use the link in the description and grab them now before the sale ends at the end of this month and so guys all of my sources are listed below there's some cool stuff down there like a map of the clubs Etc so do check them out if you want to dive deeper on this and let's go in case you forgot which I doubt any of you have the Saudi pro league spent a lot this summer not only do they provide a get out of jail free card for clubs who were looking to offload some of their aging talent that cost them a lot of money still on wages of which a few Premier League clubs took that offer but they also picked off a few young ons as well talking about gabri Vega you could lump Ruben evage in there zot Allen s maximan there was a few of these younger players that ended up going as well wasn't all just old boys now there were definitely some cheaper moves for players who were in the final year of their contract as well as free transfers such as Benzema heading to alad but the spending was still quite high of course the Premier League outspent Everybody by double which reminds me of how funny it was seeing some English pundits complain about the spending from the pro league some not all of course of course humanitarian arguments aside looking strictly at the spending it's funny to see fans of English clubs complain about their talent being picked off when that's well what the rest of Europe has to put up with when the Premier League clubs come calling for their talent similarly South American clubs get rated by Portuguese and Spanish clubs all the time but anyway bit of a tangent there as you can see here thanks to this graph from Bloomberg the Premier League spent twice as much as the rest of the leagues with France coming close thanks to PSG spending about 350 m million euros in the summer and on and on it goes now Saudi Arabia spending follow suit with them investing greatly in sport to make Saudi Arabia more relevant on the world stage for things outside of their oil exports to diversify in a sense there are also tourism campaigns that Ronaldo and Messi are a part of to bring people to the country and of course you can't escape those sportswashing allegations from humanitarian groups as well who point to the mass executions that are still occurring in the country as the rate of execution has doubled in the last 6 years I won't go into that further that was just to contextualize what some believe the reasons for the sudden investment in sport is for but again there are links to stories below if you'd like to read it yourself though I'd be very surprised if you haven't heard all about this already considering how much of a big topic this was in the summer now it was announced in June of 2023 that the public investment fund or the PF would take up 75% control of the four most successful clubs in the country alnas alhilal Al Ali and alad the remaining 25% would be controlled by the existing boards at the respective clubs sort of setup as a nonprofit other companies from Saudi Arabia had some ownership changes as well as they try to boost the investment in other clubs such as alcadia aldera Club Al Ola club and Al sukur FC however when you look at the most high-profile signings they have all gone to the PF funded clubs The Golden Boys of the league essentially in fact I was curious as to what percentage that foreigners make up in this Saudi pro league now and it's still dominated by local talent which is kind of cool to see 70% Saudi Arabian players and 30% foreigners according to transer marked for comparison La Liga has 41% foreigners the Premier League sits at 68.2% wow CA at 63.3% Etc reason for the Saudi pro league being low comparatively look at where many of the foreign players are signing you have teams like El Nasser who in their most recent match against al ryad had just four Saudi Arabian players in the starting lineup while Al ryad had the inverse just for foreigners now as far as the League's strength overall after this investment there isn't an exact science to calculating this but the stats Gods over at opta used a variety of metrics to come up with a world ranking of leagues and while the Saudi pro league has climbed perhaps not as much as it would have liked as it's ranked as the 27th best league in the world just behind the South Korean league and just ahead of the Israeli League one thing that I found interesting which speaks to the lopsided nature of the SPL as a whole is that opta analysts did a direct comparison between MLS and SPL and found that if you were to combine the two leagues into a single league for the sake of ranking the clubs three of the four top teams would be SPL teams Al IAD alhilal and al- Nasser no surprise there with the players they brought in however at the opposite end 13 of the 14 lowest ranked teams between the two leagues are all SPL clubs meaning that overall the MLS teams are stronger and the league is far more balanced we'll come back to this later for sure but first so has it broken into the markets around the globe yes and no as far as I can tell I'm curious actually let me know in the comments what the situation is as far as the broadcasting rights for the SPL in your respective countries yes I have read online about the various deals that the league cut with broadcasters worldwide but I'm curious ious as to what those deals really look like in practice for the average viewer in a given country how often are you actually seeing these matches and deciding to tune in as I said in the intro here in Canada Doone has the broadcasting rights they paid $500,000 to the Saudi pro league to have the rights in Canada the UK Germany Austria and Belgium and even done zone They Don't Really push to market the matches on their own platform you have to scroll all the way to the Far Far Right to even see the link to the league and even in clicking on the SPL page on Zone you will not find any of the teams outside of the pif clubs playing the three Marquee matches that you will see every single week will only involve al- Nasser alhilal Al Ali and alad so there is at least far more access to the Saudi pro league matches internationally than there was before but access doesn't equate to people watching something technically billions of people around the world could access my YouTube videos but I only get ever get into the five-digit numbers you know so the actual viewership numbers when they are released will be very interesting to see for the SPL now as far as actual match attendance in the first month of fixtures the SPL reported a 24% increase in attendance that's pretty great isn't it 24% is a massive jump think of your salary if it was increased by 24% you know that'd be great I'd love that however in going through the various attendance numbers on transfer marks beyond the likes of Al Ali and the various PF clubs seeing marked increases the rest of the teams that didn't Flash the cash on notable players let's take alai FC as an example last season their average home attendance was 4,398 this season 4798 so an increase of about 400 Spectators and predictably those numbers increased the most when they hosted one of the big four other than that not so much damak one of the more competitive teams are averaging 5537 Spectators this season well last season they averaged 3,689 hey that's a solid increase Al rad who are just behind them in the table 4,715 last season 6,65 this season however it must be noted matches against alhilal and al- Nasser saw them bring in 20.6 th000 and 19.7 th000 supporters respectively while their matches against nonpf teams would see them bring in just less than 4,000 supporters in attendance sometimes as low as 1,520 as was the case in their match against alaa the demographic that a lot of football marketing teams want to convert to supporters are the Casual supporters people who have an interest in football in so much as they will pay money for a marquee event but won't regularly go to matches between sides that are lower in the league and they might not even have a favorite team the data is quite clear here for the PF teams the people will show up for non-pf teams it can get scary there have been matches such as that between al- Riyad and Al khalij where just 144 people turned up and know you did not hear me wrong 144 four people whereas alhilal can get attendances of up to 59,000 for their home opener and can flirt with 50k for other high profile matches but their average is 28327 and at times dropping as low as 8,55 depending on who they're playing so it's as if the pif teams live in their own bubble when it comes to attendances if you're playing on one of those teams everywhere you go you'll be greeted by pretty strong crowds if you aren't on one of those teams well you may be playing in front of a crowd that has as about as many people as I have followers on Instagram not much how does the average attendance compared to other Asian Nations they're still behind the K League ISL in India Chinese Super League Iran's Persian golf pro league and the Jay League those countries have attendance issues in their own rights but still have a higher average than Saudi pro league at the moment so you can see the imbalance in interest and how that causes a problem it's almost a self-inflicted problem the big four are a spectacle that people want to see the rest not so much as people want to only spend their hard-earned money on the big games rather than the others the big four make up 90% of the total attendance for the entire league four teams 90% of the attendance now like I said in the intro this is still a new experiment in Saudi Arabia they're only just one year in and I would be stunned if they didn't change how they are Distributing their focus amongst the teams in the division but we are only speaking of the present right now as that's all that we can speak of with any sort of certainty the rest is just speculation the SPL is a tough sell because for the average viewer outside of Saudi Arabia and for the Casual football fan within Saudi Arabia there isn't anything that ties them to or brings interest to al-shabab damak alud or Al if there aren't any interesting changes to their squad what would compel the average football fan both inside and outside of Saudi Arabia to start watching them when they are a bit of an afterthought for the league itself and it's plain to see the SPL released a statement saying how they have grown internationally when it comes to their presence online their digital presence thanks to their various clubs attracting interest for their transfer market dealings that is absolutely a fact the big four teams are for sure on the radar of football fans now a lot of people who follow football can name the big four in Saudi Arabia but I was reading an article a few months ago by Saudi journalist W jabir of course linked below for you to check out yourself and he pointed to the fact that the growth of their International presence is as topheavy as the league is when it comes to attendance really as 94% of the total followers of SPL clubs on social media are thanks to those following the top four clubs the four PF clubs I feel for some of these clubs that share a city with the likes of al- Nasser and Riyad for example take a look at this map you have al- Nasser and alhilal in Cross proximity then Al ryad and al-shabab more on the outskirts of the Town not only are those two teams against it when it comes to being in a less central location but they're also against it with the lack of investment in their squads granted ALS shabab had a few nice signings like yanet carasco this past summer ever Bena has been there since 2020 but that pales in comparison to alhilal and al- Nasser who have almost entirely foreign 11s that they field bringing in genuine star players to alhilal alad al- Nasser and Al Ali will bring more of a curiosity to those teams for the League's Target markets the Casual fan in the country and the Curious football fan outside of it but instead of lifting the entire league they're lifting those four teams into the spotlight if you were to spread the wealth quite literally when speaking of the public investment fund it would make the league far more interesting but at the moment you can see how having the investment Focus simply on the top four teams has hurt the league it's not very competitive the one outlier in the standings is Al W shout out to them they aren't a pif club and yet they're above alad at the moment in my nonprofessional opinion by investing in the teams that were already popular and the most successful it seems like their Focus right now is clearly on attracting interests internationally which they have done to an extent is the whole world has sort of gone well hey lookie here but you're drawing people to the clubs that were popular already in the first place and while the less popular clubs have seen some spillover effect when the big boys come to town as we've seen there have been some shocking attendance numbers and even some fluctuations for alhilal the team that pulls in the highest average attendance that start with almost 60,000 in attendance was great but even for them matches against teams outside of the top five which is the big four plus Al Taun have most often failed to break 20,000 supporters that's about a third of the Stadium's capacity similarly you can understand why International broadcasters aren't interested in airing anything other than the big four teams which if things don't change as far as investment into clubs outside of the big four then the gap between the notoriety and interest in the big four compared to the rest of the league will continue to grow and grow to the point where the league will become less and less interesting with a similar problem to that of Portugal for example only sporting Benfica or Porto are going to win the league year upon year the gap between those three clubs and the rest of the league is way too big granted this is a problem that actually many leagues are running into nowadays in Europe Europe but with the SPL and the state funed clubs it's exacerbated that further as it essentially has become a Pay to Win model where the favored children live in their own bubble both competitively financially and even attendance wise that's where there's a difference between the SPL and the European leagues however for the most part while the same clubs may win the league over and over attendance at matches for teams up and down the league is fairly high and consistent as well and again that's not true for every single team in the top five leagues of course there are teams in Italy or Spain or what have you who struggle to fill a stadium when there isn't a big team coming to town but in general the average is higher and finally I think that there's the cold hard fact that the league has to accept right now overall the football just isn't at a level that is appealing to watch for most people I live in Canada for example I watch the Premier League the Portuguese league basically the top five leagues in Europe as well as MLS the league that's ranked 12 places above the Saudi League In This Moment by the way if I wanted to watch some lower level football I would go to some Canadian Premier League games and I myself enjoy it because I have a personal connection to it it's nowhere near the top football I watch from Europe hell not even close to that of Saudi Arabia but I can look past it because of seg connection and a desire to see the Game grow in my country I can look past the level for most of the world that connection doesn't exist with the SPL and so if you're lacking in that connection how do you rope people in with the quality of the football so until the quality of the rest of the league improves greatly there are very little motivating factors to tune in anyway I didn't follow the Chinese super league as closely back in the day and by that I mean the success of it not from the analyzing the best teams and tactics Viewpoint and so with the SPL I'm going to keep a closer eye on its growth and how they look to change things to attract the world it's a tough ask if the reaction to the Super League tells you anything it's that people like football as is and if you're going to challenge the status quo then you better be offering an incredible product they aren't yet thanks for watching guys I hope you enjoyed the holidays are enjoying the holidays and have a Happy New Year and I'll see you in 2024 [Music] ciao oh","The transcript presents an analysis of the Saudi Pro League's impact on the global football landscape after a significant recruitment drive. It questions whether the league's strategies have truly altered football and impacted audiences. Despite the influx of high-profile players, many renowned players opted out of moving to Saudi Arabia. In terms of popularity and attendance, the league has seen a mixed impact: attendance rose by 24% overall, but this increase mainly benefited the four top clubs—Al-Nassr, Al-Hilal, Al-Ahli, and Al-Ittihad—that the Public Investment Fund controls. Other teams didn't experience significant changes unless playing against these major clubs. The transcript highlights criticism that the recruitment strategy may create a financial imbalance, echoing common grievances about the English Premier League's spending trends. On a global scale, Saudi Pro League matches are gaining more broadcasting deals but still lack visibility in some markets, such as Canada and the UK. The transcript touches upon allegations of sportswashing, with Saudi Arabia being accused of using sports investments to divert attention from ongoing human rights abuses, including mass executions. While the Pro League expanded its international presence, its growth only prominently showcases the top clubs, echoing the disparities seen in the investment strategies across Europe and elsewhere. The analysis concludes that while recruitment has elevated the visibility of these Saudi clubs, the league itself remains less appealing due to the quality of football and lack of competitive balance, drawing parallels to the past experiences of the Chinese Super League.",Sportswashing,-1,No,Saudi Pro League,Saudi Arabia

IRV4LW_V8tk,Carragher doesn’t hold back when asked about Saudi Pro League 🇸🇦,my fear when the you know the transfer window was open in the middle of the summer was we just need one player who's maybe what we class in his prime and then that could just be a knock-on effect and lots of players go and now it's nothing against uh Saudi Arabia's league as such but I just think with the the money involved that's why people are going it obvious that I think it'd be a real sad day for football if players in their Prime were not playing in the biggest leagues which are the Premier League La Liga Syria the Bundesliga and the champions league and not just because we do this show this for me is the cream of the crop even more than probably better quality than International Football and I think if players in the prime were giving up that to go somewhere just for money I think it'd be a really sad day for football but I don't think we're there yet,"The speaker expresses concerns about the potential impact of Saudi Arabia's investment in football, particularly during the transfer window. They worry that if players in their prime move to the Saudi league purely for financial reasons, it could negatively affect the quality of major leagues like the Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, and others, which they regard as the pinnacle of football. Although the speaker acknowledges the substantial financial incentives offered by the Saudi league, they hope that top players will continue to prioritize competing in these elite European leagues rather than leaving for monetary gain. However, they also remark that such a scenario hasn't fully materialized yet.",Sportswashing,-1,No,Saudi Pro League,Saudi Arabia
dIfke7u5V7M,Thierry Henry shares his thoughts on the Saudi Pro League!,I don't think that yet European football is in danger I will mention Killian I think Killian saved the day because I think if Killian went then it would have been a bit different I think a lot of people would have followed around his age and what it does represent so I was happy that it didn't go uh you can understand some of the guys that that that won what they won at a certain age and went there but I think yes the MLS and other leagues will suffer because they're not getting the players that they used to get I went to the MLS for ex example uh it was it was because I also choose a certain lifestyle I wanted to be in New York still playing football so so I went there but you know one of the main concern I guess with with the the league in Saudi Arabia is that it's the human rights that are bothering people a lot and how they feel about the lb uh gtq plus Community that's what people I think are upset with why some of the players are going there,"The transcript discusses the potential impact of player transfers to the Saudi Arabian league on European football, with specific mention of Killian Mbappe's decision not to move, which is viewed positively. This decision is believed to have possibly influenced other young players to remain in Europe. However, there is concern over the Saudi league's growth affecting other leagues like the MLS, which may struggle to attract players. The speaker shares a personal experience of joining the MLS for lifestyle reasons. The discussion then shifts to human rights issues, specifically criticisms of Saudi Arabia's stance on LGBTQ+ rights, which is suggested as a significant factor causing discomfort among fans and observers regarding players' moves to the Saudi league.",Human Rights Issues,-1,No,Saudi Pro League,Saudi Arabia

Eiovy98OMxk,Why is Football Flopping In Saudi Arabia?,"Why is Football Flopping In Saudi Arabia? Saudi Arabia did some absolutely 
insane business this year. From   Cristiano Ronaldo to Neymar Jr. to Karim 
Benzema to N’Golo Kante to Sadio Mane and   a host of other incredibly experienced 
stars; too many to mention, in fact. After all that money spent on those superstars, 
one would have expected the league to immediately   attract attention from fans both in the 
country and all over the world. Now,   while there has been an increase in viewership 
in Saudi Arabia after these signings,   it’s not exactly at the point one would 
expect it to be after all that money spent. These superstars don’t appear to have converted an   incredible number of Saudi Arabians into 
the religion of football. In simple terms,   the number of fans coming to the stadiums to 
watch games has been less than impressive. Take Al-Ettifaq, for example. Even with Jordan 
Henderson, Gigi Wijnaldum, Demarai Gray, and   Steven Gerrard as coach, they had just 696 fans in 
the crowd to watch their game against Al-Riyadh. Even worse than that, the game between 
Al-Riyadh and Al Okhdood had just 133   people in the stands. That’s just plain abysmal. A   reasonably-publicized Sunday League game 
in Europe could pull about that number. The highest numbers they’re able to boast 
in Saudi Arabia are not even so crazy,   to be honest. 16,875 fans were present 
to watch Cristiano Ronaldo’s Al Nassr vs   Damac FC while 16,919 were around 
to watch Al-Ahli vs Al-Wehda. Honestly, when those millions were being doled 
out, we’re pretty sure the expectation was for   more people to immediately be interested 
in the sport because of the stars that   were coming into the country. But that 
doesn’t look like it’s currently the case. So, it begs the question, why is 
football flopping in Saudi Arabia? I mean, when you look at what the country is 
also doing with boxing, UFC, WWE, and the like,   it feels different from what’s happening with 
football. They’re able to fill up the arenas in   these different sports, even hosting really 
distinguished personalities from all over   the world, but that’s a far cry from what’s 
happening with football in the same country. Well, first of all, football is different 
from these other sports. UFC, boxing,   and WWE don’t happen often. So, it’s 
much easier to get fans to come out   in droves for that one-time event. However, with 
football, fans have to be dedicated to the sport;   they have to really love it and make it a 
tradition for them to be willing to come   out week in, week out to watch games. And 
well, developing that tradition takes time. Rome was not built in a day, and football in 
Saudi Arabia will not be built in one day,   either. Or one season, even, no matter how 
much money is pumped in in two windows. And building Rome has been made harder 
for the Saudis due to some natural causes,   too. For example, the topology of 
Saudi Arabia makes it hard for fans   to casually travel around 
for games week after week. For instance, the biggest rivalry in 
the country is Al Ittihad vs Al Hilal,   and guess what! It’s about 11 hours to go 
from one of those cities to the other. Now,   the truth is that people might actually love 
the sport in the country, but how many are   willing to travel for nearly 24 hours to 
and fro just to watch these games live. In contrast, to go from Manchester to London 
to watch a City vs Arsenal game or a United   vs Chelsea game, for example, will take 
you just 2 hours by train. See how much   easier it is to be at the stadiums in 
England and in other parts of Europe? And it’s not as simplistic as saying the Saudi 
government should just build better transportation   systems. Saudi Arabia is mostly desert, so 
that’s not exactly the easiest thing to execute. Another reason football is 
flopping in Saudi Arabia is   because viewership is overdependent on 
the superstar foreign players. For many,   coming to the stadium is not about watching 
your team and trying to spur them to victory,   it’s about watching CR7, Neymar, 
and Benzema play football live. So, what then happens if these players are   unavailable for whatever reason? 
Attendance will certainly drop. For example, attendance at Al Hilal games dropped 
from 15k to 8,500 following Neymar’s long-term   injury. And one would expect that it’d remain like 
that until next year when the Brazilian returns. And the dependence on these superstar 
players means that the clubs who can’t   afford these players don’t even get 
a boost in their viewership numbers. Also, for the number of people watching 
the sport in the league to increase,   the quality of football has to improve. The 
truth is that there are people in the Middle   East who watch the Champions League, La Liga, 
and the Premier League. Some of these guys enjoy   really good football and if they’re not assured 
of that, they’d rather not go to the stadiums. Of course, the expectation is that, with 
better players, the quality of football   will improve. But it’s not always that 
linear. A lot more work has to be done if   Saudi Arabia really wants more eyes on their 
league and more supporters in the stands. And you know one thing we’re sure of, Saudi 
Arabia will not stop putting in the work. Already,   they have secured the rights to host the 2034 
World Cup. The fact that they were the only   nation to submit a bid before FIFA’s deadline 
tells you all you need to know about their   eagerness to improve the quality, tradition, 
and visibility of football in the country. 2034 might seem like a long time out, 
but that’s just enough time for Saudi   Arabia to prepare to welcome fans 
from all parts of the world and show   the world what they have been cooking 
in their country for the last decade. So, yeah, football in Saudi Arabia 
may appear to be flopping right now,   but if the government and the league 
continue to do the right things and   make the right moves, this could just 
be the start of a very lovely story. But in your opinion, how long would 
it take the Saudi Pro League to get   to the standard of the Premier League 
or La Liga? 20 years? 50 years? 100   years? Or an eternity maybe? Tell

Bye!","The transcript examines why football has not gained significant traction in Saudi Arabia despite large investments in star players like Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar Jr., Karim Benzema, and others. Despite an increase in viewership, attendance at games remains disappointing, with examples of low turnout at matches even with high-profile players and coaches. The transcript suggests several reasons for this underperformance: the infrequent occurrence of sports like UFC or boxing, making football less appealing as it demands continuous engagement; geographical challenges that make travel between games arduous; and an overreliance on foreign superstar players which impacts attendance when they are unavailable. The quality of domestic football needs to improve to attract more viewers, as fans accustomed to European leagues expect high standards. The text mentions Saudi Arabia's intent to enhance football's standing, highlighted by securing the 2034 World Cup, indicating a long-term commitment to developing the sport in the region. There's a discussion on the timeline needed for the Saudi Pro League to reach the standards of top European leagues, posing it as an interactive question to the audience and anticipating improvements over the coming decades if investments continue. The tone remains mostly neutral, presenting facts and expectations without harsh criticism.",Geopolitical Influence,0,No,Saudi Pro League,Saudi Arabia
2S5OnnuOIos,"Why NOW in Saudi Arabia?! 💰 | Big-money transfers explained; 'Money, image and love of football'",there's a lot of interest in football in Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia were the best supported team at the World Cup in Qatar they beat Argentina who ended up winning the World Cup in Qatar they had something like 70 000 fans in Qatar I met some of them they are football mad they're football crazy and they're crazy about the Premier League now the rulers of Saudi Arabia have looked at this seen all this interest in sport uh I think the 70 of the population of Saudi Arabia is under 40. and they've thought instead of other people making money from our populations interest in sport and Football let's make money ourselves let's keep the money within our own borders we've got a league uh we need to professionalize that League we need to get better players into that league and that's what they've been doing The Sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia uh has bought majority stakes in four of their biggest clubs I think some of the other clubs in the league are going to be privatized as well and basically what Saudi Arabia wants to do is put itself on the map it wants to build on the success it had in the World Cup it wants to raise its profile now a lot of people will be saying yes at the same time they want to sport wash their image because Saudi Arabia has a very bad human rights record so this helps change their image around the world so that when you think of Saudi Arabia you don't think of Human Rights abuses you think of Cristiano Ronaldo or you think of Karim Benzema scoring goals so there is that at play as well and I think the final reason of course is that a country like Saudi Arabia is very dependent on the money it makes from selling oil and that oil is not going to last forever and they need to diversify their economy and that's why we've seen through the Sovereign wealth fund that that is exactly what they've been doing but basically they want to build their own Leisure and entertainment industry and tap into the massive amount of interest there is among the Saudi Arabian population in football but of course there are other reasons as well and Carvey we saw something similar happen in China didn't we but that peted out so what's to say that this Saudi model is actually sustainable very good question Audis have more money I think they're more serious about this than the Chinese were I think what happened in China that was almost an order that came from the president of China he said that I want us to host the World Cup I want us to have a really really good national team I want us to have a great league and so lots of businessmen in China went about buying these clubs bringing in players on massive contracts paying people like Carlos teves Hulk hundreds and hundreds and thousands of pounds a week but then the ruling Communist party in China had a change of heart they didn't like the fact that all this money was flowing out of China into Europe and into foreigners pockets as they saw it and they decided basically to end it and loads of rules were introduced about how many foreign players you could have in the Chinese super league and that is why it petered out I get the sense that these Saudis are more serious about this and this one has more legs than the Chinese Super League had I mean the Chinese Super League is still going uh it just doesn't have the kind of wages and the kind of foreign players playing there who were going there back in what seven or eight years ago is there a danger Carvey that the influx of Saudi money will distort the transfer market globally I think there is I mean we've seen for the first time this summer uh every sort of transfer you talk about you're mentioning these Saudi clubs and players who you would think are impossible for anyone to buy for instance son from Tottenham uh there is serious interest in him from Saudi Arabia now Spurs have made it clear that he's not for sale but basically Saudi Arabia has the money to buy any player they want as long as the player wants to move there and of course a lot of players at the very peak of their careers will say no I don't want to go and play in Saudi Arabia now but I think that has changed a little bit with Ruben Neves because he's somebody who Liverpool Manchester United Barcelona were interested in he's only 26 so at the peak of his career he's decided yes I would like to go to Saudi Arabia I mean obviously that could have a lot to do with money but it has changed the transfer market because clubs now have competition from Saudi Arabian teams for their players but also they've got a market to sell their players as well a very very lucrative Market has opened up one club in particular is Chelsea that's been linked with possibly a number of players moving on to Saudi Arabia is that potentially a way of getting around the financial fair play problems they're facing well this is interesting this is a this is something that's been brought up a lot in the last couple of days because obviously Chelsea have spent so much money 600 million pounds over the last two windows they need to balance their books they need to sell some of their players and out of the blue suddenly the Saudis have come along and said yeah we'll have some of your players and we've got 100 million pounds to give you so people from the outside are looking in and maybe saying looks a little bit strange suddenly you've come up with a way to balance the books and people have also said uh that the public investment fund of Saudi Arabia who owns these Saudi clubs has also invested in a U.S private Equity Fund Clear Lake Capital who are majority shareholders at Chelsea and people have sort of try to see if there's something strange going on there but from what we're being told that has got nothing to do with it the public investment fund of Saudi Arabia sorry The Sovereign wealth fund invest in lots of private Equity firms all over the world and Clear Lake has investments in like 400 different companies so Chelsea would say that there is absolutely no conflict of interest there whatsoever but obviously you know you're going to be hearing a lot more about players moving to clubs in Saudi Arabia because I think the Saudis are here to stay they're very very serious about this and obviously they've got the money basically to do what they want,"The transcript discusses Saudi Arabia's burgeoning interest in football, particularly in the context of sports investments aimed at enhancing their league and profile. A significant part of this strategy involves the Sovereign Wealth Fund, which has acquired major stakes in key domestic clubs. The move aims to capitalize on domestic enthusiasm for the sport, exemplified by their robust support at the World Cup in Qatar, and also to diversify an economy heavily reliant on oil. Concerns about sportswashing are noted, as the country's efforts could shift global perceptions from human rights issues to football success and iconic players like Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema. Comparisons to China's previous football expansions are drawn, noting differences in commitment and sustainability. The transcript also examines potential impacts on the global transfer market, suggesting Saudi investments could distort player valuations and provide teams, like Chelsea, an opportunity to alleviate financial challenges by selling players at high prices. Links between Chelsea and Saudi investments via mutual stakes in a U.S. private equity fund are mentioned, but dismissed as coincidental rather than indicative of direct financial manipulation or conflicts of interest.",Sportswashing,-1,No,FIFA World Cup 2022,Saudi Arabia

firmino Gone sadio Mane looks like he is going to go as well in case you missed it yesterday John Laporte the Barcelona president was in the studio and I asked him about whether or not this was bad for football well the third crazy deals that for me I understand that the Saudi Arabia want to promote the the the pro league the Saudi but without respect I I respect their decisions but I think that there is another way to improve the football in in Saudi because they did better were in the World Cup they are passionate football fans and at the same time they have the you know the power to develop the football in Saudi to me it's better to to to profit the experience of the traditional clubs in order to reach associations or agreements of cooperation with Saudi clubs and transfer our you know how our technology our methods our in order to improve football there Talent is important the players are very implant the players but you know is is not enough football is a team sport it's not you know an individual sport it's not tennis team and of course that for publicity is fantastic but in order to improve the the quality of football there if to me I have my adoption do you think it's a problem for football not a problem no because you know football is the most popular sport in the world and there is a country that has enough power in order to invest in football and they invest in in players in specific players to me this is good for the publicity but there is another ways to improve the quality of football in this country how affecting the rest of the leagues and I think that Saudi they want to be in four or five years in the top five leagues in the world it's perfect you know we will compete probably and but in this moment still the players prefer a sporting proposal than the big players yeah and financial proposal do you agree Frank do you think that maybe they're going about it the wrong way if you want to grow a league you've got to grow within the country as opposed to just getting these big names over well it's more complicated than that I think it's nice to uh to to put the spotlights on the on the on the country who wants to develop in in football having names it's always nice yeah it's been proven that uh um having big names at the end of their career doesn't bring anything we saw we saw that with Japan we saw that with the um with Qatar and I was one of them we saw that with uh even the United States and now we're seeing that with uh Saudi Arabia I think uh Mr laporta forgot one thing tradition culture that's what it's what it is and the key for me of uh of developing football is to create a real culture we can see in the states where the culture is more about American football but baseball basketball but football or soccer has a hard time to uh to develop himself and to be shown at the the best country the best vote in the in the world so it's hard to when you don't have that culture or the tradition to to really be at the top of it and be quickly at the time top of it we live in a dictator of emergency and we we see that as our Arabia doesn't want to waste any time but they will have to get the time to be better and to make sure that the the youth are there to carry on uh the tradition that they want to put to be put in takes time Robert it does and Frank's absolutely right you've got to start getting better coaches if you're going to spend a lot of money get the best coaches from around the world you've got Stephen Gerard coach you I'm talking about coaching the youth teams the youth players building a culture making the the youth team players much much better and and making sure they get the right philosophies the right coaching and then still spend money on some of the big players it will go together you putting yourself out there Robert no you know this is too good for me next being next to you on a Friday yeah that's a dream Iris of course one of them did he ever put you on the floor Kieran uh probably yeah not not something that I would want to remember but yeah when he was at his pump it must have been oh so difficult to go up against someone like that oh yeah yeah and I mean slightly off of subject but you need to replace him right um because he's he's come up with big big numbers and he's putting big performances at the right times for City over the last few years and you say Eddie's Pop I think he's still at his pump right okay still producing oh great performances he scored a hat trick in the FA Cup semi-final brilliant hat trick he's still a top class player no doubt about that are you a fan Frank I am I am I saw him playing when he was young and I saw him developing you know in England and uh and in fact I feel sad because he's only 32 I think he would have been able to uh to play two three maybe four more years at the top of the top but I understand I always say that we never judge a player over 30 if he decides to go to secure his family uh and and siblings so um um I'm just sad but the guy was because now we can talk about the past because again he's going for lower league he he was one of the best player at this position in the world uh just a

including Jordan Henderson, Riyad Mahrez, Karim Benzema, Roberto Firmino, and Sadio Mane, to Saudi Arabia, raising questions about the impact of these transfers on global football. Joan Laporta, the Barcelona president, and others discuss whether the influx of players to the Saudi Pro League is beneficial for football. Laporta suggests Saudi Arabia has other avenues to improve their league, such as leveraging the experience of traditional clubs, developing local talent, and enhancing football culture. It's noted that having big players does raise attention, but tradition and culture are essential for sustainable development. This thought is echoed by other commentators who stress the need for building a footballing culture and coaching young talent in Saudi Arabia. They argue that while high-profile transfers can spotlight Saudi football, true growth requires developing infrastructure and coaching talent, similar to attempts made by Japan, Qatar, and the United States. Meanwhile, there is an acknowledgment that expenditures and investments are necessary, but they should be targeted towards creating a robust football environment. Furthermore, the conversation touches on player motivations for moving to Saudi Arabia, balancing personal career opportunities with financial incentives. The importance of nurturing homegrown talent is underscored as crucial for long-term development in Saudi football, with emphasis on establishing a tradition and a solid foundation that requires time and dedication.

that we're a few dissenting voices those that were a bit unsure as to whether they wanted to get into their cars after leaving the track meetings continued for another four hours the ultimate decision racing Will Go On [Music] the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix can be tracked back to 2019 when plans for a Grand Prix in the country were first announced formula one has traveled to various corners of the globe that no Grand Prix has attracted as much controversy as Saudi Arabia it was November 2020 when it was officially announced that the city of Jeddah would host the inaugural Saudi Arabian Grand Prix there was one issue the circuits didn't exist now yes there were plans and Designs but many fans were speculating whether the circuit would even be finished on time and if the race would be held in 2021 work began and it went rapidly the circuit seemed to be up and ready in no time though just weeks before the Grand Prix people were still speculating about whether this track would even be finished now of course when the original circuit was revealed it received a lot of backlash before we've even seen cars on track people were quick to say that this was one of the worst circuits in F1 many people pointed out that the layout resembled that of a butter knife and a question of safety was hovering above the track but the big story was a simple question should F1 even go to Saudi Arabia while F1 promoted their Wii race as one message a race in Saudi Arabia in the eyes of many F1 fans contradicted this entire message questions around human rights breaches and past controversies really bought Saudi Arabia into the news headlines in addition to that many F1 fans once again realized that money can pretty much get you whatever you want a Formula One race before you even have a built circuit in the lead-up to the very first Saudi Arabian Grand Prix the event was constantly talked about whether it be the human rights issues the circuits or the fact that money can buy whatever you want it was a major story which Contin continued until the very first practice session up to 45 different human rights organizations urged Lewis Hamilton to boycott the Grand Prix Saudi Arabia's response to allegations of sports washing was that it was just part of the country's efforts to open itself up to the outside world questions also were asked about the security of the event after what happened at the 2021 Daria e pre Formula One said that they would never go to a high security risk area and had confidence in these Saudi governments that everything would be safe and smooth fast forwarding to the 2022 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix what would take place shocked viewers smoke was seen above the circuit and we later learned that this was an attack on a local aramco oil Depot this was approximately 16 kilometers from the circuits which occurred during the first two practice sessions suddenly F1 fans drivers and Personnel were on edge there were talks about the race potentially being canceled and a meeting was held which lasted into the early hours of the morning drivers discussed the risks of racing but later agreed that the race would go ahead after safety was guaranteed by the Saudi government the decision to go ahead was met with plenty of criticism and had people further asking the questions what can money buy you in this sport going back to the Circuit after two Formula One races many people have come to enjoy this racetrack it is described as the fastest street circuits on the calendar with physically and mentally demanding Corners all over the racetrack it's fast and flowing layout gives a sense that the drivers are absolutely and totally on the limits and in my opinion provides probably the best on-board lap that you can see we've also seen some hard crashes and incidents at the circuits which definitely proves that the margin for error at this track is very small for example Mick Schumacher's crash was one of the more violent and brutal ones that I've seen seen in recent years thankfully he was okay but it's definitely not an incident I want to see again the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix is one of the more controversial races that I can remember basically as soon as the rumors came out that F1 was looking at a race in Saudi Arabia the controversy and criticism started but the Jeddah Street circuit isn't even the end of the road for F1 in Saudi Arabia with the original plan all along being to race in the super city of kudia at this moment it's looking like it will be ready in 2027 so until then we should remain at this street circuits in Jeddah but since then it's also been talked about possibly alternating between the two tracks Formula One in Saudi Arabia was and continues to be a controversial topic every year now I'd love to hear from you what are your thoughts on the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix what do you think of the racetrack and just give give me some of your general thoughts I'm definitely interested in reading

r4K8V8btCtY,Saudi Arabia Exploits F-1 Racing For Sportswashing,according to a saudi arabian official an oil storage facility was attacked the fire and smoke lit up the sky as fans were making their way to a sports event this is the view from the hyatt house hotel where i'm staying and this aramco facility must be probably no more than 10 kilometers from here it's been going for several hours now and when i was driving back from the track you could just see this orange glow in the sky kim ilman a well-known photographer gave us insights from his hotel room and there's no way they're extinguishing that in a hurry that's going to burn for some time i'd suggest it's an attack by from what i've read and you probably read the same thing some yemenis [Music] [Music] however this was not just any sports event now the attack came just 48 hours ahead of a formula one race however so the authorities have pledged that the upcoming grand prix would go on as planned although the second practice was delayed due to heavy smoke in the area the second practice run was delayed by 15 minutes due to the heavy smoke it was the saudi arabia grand prix a few kilometers away the famous faces of world motorsport navigating this same scenario as the blaze held up practice formula one has seen a huge swing in popularity and let's be real you think these guys were gonna let an attack close by stop their investment well think again according to the bbc the drivers spent four hours after practice on friday discussing whether the race should be run but eventually at 2 30 a.m local time on saturday they agreed to race bbc sport learned that a significant number of drivers had concerns about the safety of the event following the attack eventually they were convinced to go ahead and race after being given further information by bosses part of this information involved a possible consequences of not racing such as how easily teams and drivers would be able to leave the country if the race did not happen on sunday lewis hamilton along with many other drivers expressed their concern the successful brit even went on the record saying i am just looking forward to getting out the weekend dominated by the missile attack almost resulted in a driver boycott of the race with distaste at the regime's appalling human rights record and fears for the safety of their teams it took that long meeting before drivers were ultimately placated and persuaded to race after these attacks the drivers and their teams expressed concern because of course who wouldn't the guardian wrote of hrw's findings they cite the regular use of torture on detainees same-sex relations remain illegal punishable by flogging or imprisonment the state has made much play of how progressive it has been in allowing women the right to drive however hrw reports some prominent activists spent nearly three years in prison for peacefully protesting for that right they remain under suspended sentences banned from travel and prohibited from pursuing their human rights work all of which f1 was more than aware when they first agreed to race in saudi arabia last year but they were reminded in no uncertain terms of exactly with whom they were dealing just days before arriving in the country on march 12th the state executed 81 men in a single day reprieve which investigates in campaigns against human rights abuses said it was wrong for the sport to have a race in the nation director maya foa spoke with the standard f1 ceo says saudi arabia is headed in the right direction when the kingdom is on track to execute almost 500 people this year more than twice as ever before by racing there so soon after a mass execution formula one is signaling there will be no consequences for executing people who took part in pro-democracy protests the 10-year deal f1 has just signed with the kingdom is effectively a contract to sportswash mohammed bin salman's blood-soaked regime obviously at this point everyone watching knows of the cia's findings that mbs and the saudi regime killed and dismembered washington post journalist jamal khashoggi while i do understand these sentiments the sports washing from saudi arabia has been in full motion this is not anything new my lone question to the drivers is this what did you expect at this point you're all pawns in the f1 game and i know that this is harsh to say but when a company like formula one a really powerful sports organization solidifies a near one billion dollar investment just to see you guys go 230 240 plus miles per hour what did you expect i also understand that many athletes like to stay away from these questions and these serious issues and subjects but when you visit a country like this and you know the human rights violations that are going on the questions also come with the territory specifically specifically the human rights violations and the number of executions that are occurring in the very same country where you guys are supposed to be racing the guardian reported hamilton was believed to be one of the drivers strongly in favor of canceling the race and after taking the 10th place he only wanted to leave quote i am so happy the weekend is done i am so happy that everyone is safe i am just looking forward to getting out i just want to go home redbull's max for stopping won the race but said we had a lot of guarantees that of course it would be safe but after this weekend all the drivers together we will speak with f1 and the team bosses to see what is happening for the future it appears though many are starting to call for change in the sport eye news is kevin garside wrote what events in jada highlight is the peril for all sports not just formula one engaging in dangerous liaisons with questionable regimes for cash f1 was shocked to its core once the nature of the attack was understood the drivers wanted no further part of the action it is clear the drivers do not enjoy being asked to account for f1's presence in the middle east the fate of 14 year old boys on death row should not be hamilton's to resolve hamilton said the events leading up to qualifying had no bearing on the outcome as a professional he has to shut that stuff out when he is in the car but out of it he was clearly agitated and uncomfortable at being asked to race here good luck getting him and others to commit again to this degree of stress and peril for that is what it was and all in the name of sport and here's another thing there is large interest because of the ascension and popularity of this sport for many host cities to say we'll take you on we'll make an investment as well it seems like there's a long queue to join f1 which is holding a record 23 race season the sport's popularity has risen with netflix series drive to survive and was boosted by last year's thrilling duel for the drivers championship between lewis hamilton and verstappen currently saudi arabia is leading a coalition against the iran-backed houthis who seized yemen's capital of sana in september 2014. the kingdom entered the war in yemen in 2015 and has been internationally criticized for its airstrikes killing civilians the associated press then asked if f1 should not be going to places that are at war like russia then why go to saudi arabia a damn good question human rights watch also reported that in its seven year war in yemen saudi arabia has a sordid record of unlawful attacks targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure in areas held by the houthi armed group let it be noted that f1 acted with unprecedented speed to cancel the russian gp within hours of their invasion of ukraine yet has not batted an eyelid to what is happening in yemen amnesty international uk had a campaign said we are calling in everyone involved with the race drivers managers fans to educate themselves and be prepared to speak up and speak out about saudi human rights violations with many sports organizations taking a principled stance over russia's aggression in ukraine the line that sport and politics don't mix won't hold water despite claims that sport going to the kingdom of saudi arabia would lead to positive changes we are instead witnessing the opposite the human rights situation in saudi is bad and getting worse the jiddah grand prix is yet another example of bald-faced sports washing with the hopes that the glitz and glamour of f1 rolling into town will detract from these grotesque violations of human rights prior to last year's race in the gulf kingdom hamilton expressed discontent over the decision to add the saudi gp to the f1 season do i feel comfortable here i wouldn't say i do hamilton admitted during a press or prior to the race but it's not my choice to be here the sport has taken the choice to be here f1's repeated refrain when called to answer such criticism is that they believe they can affect positive change in the countries they visit nelson mandela held the opposite opinion in believing how important the sporting boycott was in helping an apartheid in south africa worse still there is no evidence any change ever occurs the real danger with sports washing is that it normalizes regimes over time the fuss dies down as people come to accept the event but business as usual continues in the background this is the deal f1 has done,"The transcript details an incident involving a missile attack on a Saudi Arabian oil facility just days before a Formula One race. Despite safety concerns and discussions among drivers—fueled by the attack's proximity and Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record—the race proceeded as planned. The transcript discusses the dilemma faced by athletes and the governing bodies of sports like F1 choosing to engage with nations with controversial reputations. It highlights significant human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia, including a high-profile execution and the kingdom's involvement in the Yemen conflict, and criticizes the notion of sports fostering progress within such regimes. Numerous reports from media outlets, alongside statements from human rights organizations, were mentioned, voicing the sentiment that sports involvement in these nations might not lead to the positive change often claimed. The transcript touches on the concept of sportswashing, noting that such high-profile events can serve to distract from and normalize the oppressive actions of the regime. The role of prominent figures like Lewis Hamilton was explored, emphasizing their discomfort and moral quandary about participating in events under such conditions. Furthermore, it draws a contrast with sports' rapid response to geopolitical conflicts elsewhere, such as F1's quick cancellation of the Russian Grand Prix following the invasion of Ukraine, indicating a perceived inconsistency in policy driven by financial interests.",Sportswashing,-1,No,Formula 1,Saudi Arabia

During a media day, the human rights situation in Bahrain emerged as a significant topic, with 61 British MPs and political activist groups urging Formula 1 to commission an independent inquiry into alleged human rights abuses in the country. However, Formula 1's new president, Stefano Domenicali, reportedly responded that F1 is not equipped to take on such investigations, pointing out the limitations as a cross-border investigatory organization. Lewis Hamilton, a prominent F1 driver, has received letters from Bahraini nationals claiming they were victims of human rights abuses and has spent time educating himself on the issue by consulting legal and human rights experts, as well as officials in Bahrain and the UK ambassador. Hamilton feels his efforts should be private to avoid jeopardizing progress but is committed to helping. The discussion highlights the complex societal structure of Bahrain, a Sunni minority ruling over a Shia majority, with a significant British expat and American military presence. Observers have noted peaceful protests in the country, and a belief within F1 that engagement is more productive than isolation. The perspective shared aligns with Hamilton's view that sport can bridge cultural divides.

6zEf9o-tTpc,Formula 1's Europe Problem,"Formula 1 has long relied on Europe for good reason after all the birthplace of F1 is in Europe and with majority of fans residing there with the sport embedded in various different cultures F1 has solidified itself as the dominant category in the region which sees large crowd numbers flock to the event in order to get a glimpse of their favorite drivers piloting some of the most technologically advanced machines in the world but I think we are currently in the middle of a major shift and I don't think I'm alone in saying that for example there was a time where no Formula 1 races had existed in the Middle East and the USA was a tough market for F1 to get a hold of due to fans not showing too much interest in the product much preferring to follow homegrown categories such as NASCAR and indicar whereas now we have four races in the Middle East excluding aaban which is in close proximity to the region and the USA sees three races on the current calendar with more seemingly on the way due to formula 1's rapid expansion in a booming Market Europe still leads the way with nine total races and many may think Europe still dominates the calendar because of this but as time goes on Formula 1 shifts further and further away from their Homeland and plans to continue building in the USA and the Middle East which raises a big question for the future of the F1 calendar is Formula 1 moving away from Europe Bernie Eon acquired the television broadcasting rights to Formula One which saw him gain a firm grip on the sport in what was a competitive arm wrestle among Executives for power within Formula 1 in the 1970s which has since been labeled as the fisa focer war in simple terms a battle for control between the governing body and the constructors association with Bernie solidifying his position of Top Dog in in Formula 1 alongside Max Mosley he made it his mission to unlock the sports full potential and reach by expanding into new countries using broadcasting deals and tapping into new markets which would attract new fans sponsors and revenue streams to turn F1 into a global phenomenon it's important to know that a lot happened under Bernie eon's control but so that we don't drift away from the topic of the video we're going to stick purely to race expansion and Formula 1 shift into new markets Formula 1 became an attractive product for countries and cities to consider hosting despite the large investment involved the cars were fast loud technologically advanced and the sport was a huge spectacle F1 would expand further into Asia with Malaysia and then China Singapore Korea and India meaning Japan was no longer the only Formula 1 race in Asia which began all the way back in 1976 the Middle East also made its way onto the calendar in 20 4 with Bahrain and would later see Abu Dhabi Qatar and Saudi Arabia host races in Formula 1 the United States has been involved in Formula 1 for a very long time but it was a market where Formula 1 struggled to leave their Mark and become a location where the sport truly made an impact it seemed like Formula 1 was at a loss of what to do with the USA and it seemed like nothing could really fall into their favor the audience never really jelled with the European product and after the disaster of the 200 5 Indianapolis Grand Prix Formula 1 wouldn't return until the Circuit of the Americas was built in Austin Texas so what exactly changed and how has the interest in hosting such an expensive event risen to unprecedented [Music] levels it's 2020 and the pandemic has stolen headlines across the globe everything is shutting down the gym restaurants school work Sports Formula 1 would shut down until July where F1 would host the first race of the season in Austria in what would see a major reshuffle of the calendar to accommodate the uncertainty of what was happening Formula 1 would utilize the back-to-back model on three separate occasions to add an extra three races to the calendar with two races in Austria at Silverstone and two in Bahrain using an alternate layout for the second Grand Prix most of these races would happen behind closed doors meaning Grand stands were empty but with majority of the world's population stuck at home with not much to do besides Channel surf until something moderately interesting popped up Formula 1 became a CO sport something people would watch because it was on TV and in some way they were forced to watch it with this just a year prior Netflix released their brand new series drive to survive which followed the Formula 1 World in 2018 and documented what goes on behind the scenes and gave an insight into to the lives of the drivers and teams the series exploded it sent the F1 world into the stratosphere meaning millions of people had become fans of the sport this was only the beginning drive to survive would release season 2 and the fan base for not just the show but the sport continued to Skyrocket interest in Formula 1 was at an all-time high and when 2021 came around the Stars aligned and bought us one of the best Formula 1 seasons of all time the total viewers in 2021 sat at 1.55 billion an increase of 4% on the previous Co year the USA alone saw a 58% increase in viewers only behind the Netherlands followers across socials were up 40% to a combined 49.1 million followers the USA saw more fans walk through the gates than ever before with 400,000 people attending the grum Prix weekend this is still with limited capacity 2.69 million fans attended Formula 1 events throughout 2021 during a time where tracks could only allow limited capacities due to co restrictions the demand for F1 was on another level and since then F1 has consistently sold out events across the world the harsh truth is times have changed with Formula 1 more popular than ever before the sport relying on Europe is no longer a factor as multiple races in other countries and now very much financially viable the days of low attendance numbers causing bad ticket sales are in the past fans would sell their soul for a Formula 1 ticket nowadays and circuits are more packed than they have ever been before there's a sort of reluctancy to extend contracts at some of our beloved racetracks because formula 1's Direction has changed the sport is somewhat now not just being seen as a show but being treated like one with over-the-top facilities and quirks that you just aren't going to to see at a place like spa or the now gone from the calendar French Grand Prix formula 1's focus in the United States is gaining strength as the seasons go on and more and more races are being floated to be a potential F1 race tracks that we love such as spa for example which is widely regarded as the ultimate F1 track may be living on borrowed time with a contract until 20125 spar's contract extensions seem short with reluctancy on F1 side the product of Formula 1 is so attractive now but space is very much limited a 30 round calendar is far too long and honestly cruel to the teams and Personnel who need to make that life commitment therefore someone has to give my stance Remains the Same history should always feature in Formula 1 Spa may not provide amazing racing edge of your seat racing but it still needs to exist in order to showcase the rich history of our great sport with the Market opening up Formula 1 no longer relies on its European audience to buy tickets and pack the grand stands the tickets now sell themselves to anybody and everybody across the globe the Middle East investment in Formula 1 is just about unmatched with seemingly unlimited cash to spend it puts the Middle East in pole position to secure long contracts because the future of the circuits and races is a sure thing to Formula 1 it's not like European Racers are struggling to sell their tickets but the shift towards focusing on the show could mean we see less and less European races as the seasons progress it could mean an equal number of races in the US Asia the Middle East and Europe but one thing is for sure Formula 1 no longer truly relies on Europe for","The transcript discusses the evolution of Formula 1's geographical focus from its traditional European roots to a more global presence, especially in the Middle East and the USA. Initially, F1 races were predominantly held in Europe, where the sport originated and had a large fanbase. However, a significant shift is now underway, with F1 expanding its calendar to include four races in the Middle East and three in the USA, alongside new ventures in Asia. This expansion is attributed to the efforts made by former F1 executive Bernie Ecclestone, who aimed to tap into new markets and broaden the sport's appeal. The text details how factors such as the global COVID-19 pandemic and the popularity of Netflix's ""Drive to Survive"" series have contributed to a surge in F1's viewership and popularity, particularly in the USA.",Geopolitical Influence,0,No,Formula 1,Saudi Arabia
_tSI_JV5lZY,I FLEW to a F1 race in the MIDDLE EAST...,"this might just be the most exclusive ticket in Formula 1 this plane is empty except for us because these tickets are not for sale are you

baby oh it's good to be back this feels like flashbacks to the first video I ever posted the first video on the Channel all right yeah that was the snow the snow day where cars and buses were all over the place yeah on the road we were roommates back then and Trent was my very first subscriber in fact he was in most of my early videos doing weird things like Bob sledding to tandem bike riding to motorcycle trips together this weird gyroscopic gym equipment thing but most importantly we hosted an annual go-kart Championship together and it has always been competitive between us but since then I've kept up my love for cars and racing right on the edge but so has he now the question I have is how do I know what I'm taking you on is your dream trip and I think with any man there's one good

he's into he also runs our fantasy F1 league and he even recently did a formula 4D track day which is basically the closest experience you can have to a Formula 1 driver by just being a normal person

Trend and with the way I pour you can tell I don't fly this way way too often either well Cheers Cheers wait is this an A380 is this a double decker is this a double decker bus Airline style exactly I'm trying to figure out why I have an iPad to control your entertainment system then is this some sort of gam same yeah oh why why have one when you can have two now I know I've mentioned it but we are not paying for this trip so I need to explain how all this is coming to be why it's all taken care of exactly a year ago today I was flying to my first ever F1 race trying to spend as little money as I could and I went to the barin Grand Prix where I stayed in a little hotel with a beach and I made friends with two guys at my hotel who were from Germany Vincent and cenan and they gave me a ride to the track and back every day I loved being at the F1 race but more surprisingly I learned a lot about a little country I hadn't heard much about other than they host an F1 race because I came for the race I got to visit this small island in the Middle East Bahrain so how does that get us here sitting at a private bar in the sky reserved for first class and business class passengers and we are not paying for any of it B glass who's counting at this altitude they don't count well a month after I posted that video I received an email from the CEO of the bin International circuit saying how much he enjoyed that video and that he'd lik to invite me as his guest to this year's race of course I said yes but but until I got onto this plane I wasn't even sure it was real oh yes yes it would oh we'll go back to back classic I didn't even realize but we are in the middle of making new memories this is one of those moments we could have just sat down but because she took a Polaroid picture it suddenly made it a moment that will remember that's cool that's a really great way to look at it now speaking of moments that stick with you let me explain this flyover when I came to the bin F1 race last last year I was sitting in the stands and was absolutely Blown Away by the golf air flyover at the beginning of the race so when I got invited by the CEO of the track I asked if it would be possible to ride in that plane there was a pause and then he said I'll see what I can do hey if you don't ask you'll never know but for now we have another 12 hours in business class and we're making the most of it pajamas and clearly nothing has changed we're just as competitive as [Music] always F I swear I didn't cheat I swear to speed this along we board one more flight in Dubai at least we get to sit next to each other this time finally and then you can't cheat when we play Battleship oh yeah and this 2hour flight has us finally arriving at our destination and just like that one year later I'm back in Bahrain only this time things are going to be very different that's us good morning good morning all okay all okay you're most welcome thank you you're where do we go this is for us this is for you wow a year ago when I arrived I had to get myself a taxi a lot can change in a year okay this is a beautiful car you're lucky but last year I came alone so it's nice to be able to share this with Trent and with no news yet about the approval on the flyover our chauffeur fuad is is taking us to the hotel to get settled in thank you very much hello thank you oh I guess we're in the right place this hotel is a little bigger than the one I booked last year honestly I don't even want to know how much this costs oh my goodness so this is how the other 1% of the world lives okay he wasn't lying all right let's go check in [Music] look at that door let's see oh my gosh holy this is perfect our bags are already here look at this view ah I know we all want the bathroom tour my gosh that's amazing holy wow um oh my lost for words I didn't know these places exist lovely room but we didn't come to hang out in the hotel room you want to go go- caring yes please I think we're here let's go go-karting yeah we're in the right place this looks like the entrance to a real track this is this is for go-karting what a stunning night wait what's that up there clearly I'm still thinking about the possibility of being in the flyover which is why I've looked up and noticed this jumping out of the helicopter is the Red Bull parachute team in fact they're rehearsing their own pre-race flyover stunt well now I'm really jealous wow it's a bit of a reminder of how much goes into hosting one of these races well it's our turn for go-karting this is the bin International carting circuit and they've held World Championships here and uh we're about to go head to head I've never raced on a professional carting track before and it couldn't be a nicer night for it in fact the Formula 1 track is right next door and they both have a very similar track layout and since we're driving at Sunset these are the same conditions the F1 drivers will be racing with in just a few nights time but realistically between Trent and I it doesn't matter if it's a small indoor track or this slick Championship hosting outdoor cing track somehow we always find ourselves battling each [Music] other I guess not much has changed after [Music] all I don't want to brag but Trent and Ice had some blistering lap times out there that I don't think can be beat today that is until this guy showed up yep that's Lando Lando I left some gas in this one for you it's all warmed up how was that that was Unreal that was a really good track and Norris isn't the only one coming go-karting either Alex albon's right in front of me this is the type of thing that can only happen when you go to events in person sorry sorry we were the last people to race on that track and now Alex Al and Lando Norris are on there that's true George Russ is getting he's late but he's here I guess they're just out here to have some fun too before the race this weekend I can't believe the D I can't I can't I can't believe I just can't believe it someone asks you do you want to do something that somewhat interests you yeah do it you never know what'll come this feels a little like bringing a kid to Disneyland yeah this I'm getting the same feeling as the parent you know parents say they do it for themselves they don't do it for the kid oh my goodness I get it now I realized this feels like a little personal race Before the Race we're getting a pre-show here hello so we enjoy it inshah yes thank you for your patience good morning that was an incredible first day uh we've got a whole other day to oursel today I think we should go see bahin a little bit what do you think it's a great idea oh my gosh it's a Grand Prix chocolate board you you want a breakfast chocolate I definitely do that's too rich for breakfast but I'm not complaining now I heard a little news this morning that getting approvals for the flyover are not exactly easy but they're still working on it so that gives us a little bit of time this morning to explore the capital city of Mana I mean heck we've come halfway around the world so I want to see what bahin is like Beyond on the track there's no traffic lights for pedestrians we know we have a driver a chauffeur we just thought we'd go for a walk what a lucky guy to be walking around and not holding the stress or worry of whether these approvals are going to work or not this barin post this is the post office that's nice the spot we've been told to go see is the Manama souk the capital city of Bahrain is Manama Manama Manama I I'll learn how to pronounce it I swear now the Manas is a nice are with narrow streets and friendly vendors that will sell you just about anything you could possibly need I me hello very friendly hello good day there are so many little Alleyways and roads here fun is this feels like a CA considering the f1s going on this weekend I thought it'd be busier in here but I guess F1 fans don't have markets at the top of the list of places to see in Bahrain okay no than you thank you oh no thank you how you good how are you good hi right uh popcorn you might not be able to sell me any souvenirs but I will always buy popcorn but honestly it's kind of fun holy we got to get one this is one of the reasons I always travel with local cash that was good cheers I a su up of fresh every day warm I'm not going to lie no idea how much this cost but I don't really care you never know when you're going to come across fresh bread bin is incredibly safe Trent and I don't have any problems wandering around the back streets and just kind of seeing it and as we're walking through these narrow streets here this is the moment I get the text that says the flyover is a go for tomorrow so now all I have to do is keep it a secret from him oh wow that's beautiful so with our 10,000 steps in for the day it's time to head back to the hotel real game TR it is like real life Frogger going going as you can see I can hardly contain my excitement so it's time for a new distraction oh my gosh at the beach here look at this sand I mean we are in Bahrain we might as well enjoy it so a quick cool dip in the Arabian Gulf and tonight we've been invited to a party little beach front restaurant should be fun but realistically I'm just excited about this flyover tomorrow he's hyped he's hyped I'm hyped for day about well that was a fun day that was a great day yeah see you good night oh morning it's going to be a beauty of a day this whole trip has been full of surprises all right so I have kept Trent in the well out of the loop of a lot of things oh there's my car there sorry did you see who that was going in no I didn't see [Music] oh who's behind me you might see tonight and at this moment Trent has no idea we're headed back to the airport and for me this is a big deal this feels like my culmination of 7 years on YouTube all the early videos I made with Trent and even all my random airplane Adventures since then starting with aircraft museums then flying simulators riding in old P by planes and even going behind the scenes of the San Francisco International Airport but this this feels different so we're at the airport as you can see currency exchange behind us this is the bin International Airport Lobby arrivals we're staying in the airport we we're going to go we're going somewhere and I don't know where we're waiting for clearance I don't want to jinx it I'm not going to say anything until we're on the aircraft cuz there's a there's a chance this doesn't happen fingers crossed so I want to reinfor for the point that we are in the international terminal but they have our passports but we will be returning here in a matter of hours or or less and I couldn't be happier than to have Trent alongside for one more ride I literally do not know what's happening next no idea oh he's back oh here thank you thank you for the ride I don't even know what to say which is getting whis away at the operational level through heavy security what happens at the beginning of the race before it starts sometimes in some places a fly over a military EO it's like right yeah but here it was a fly over by the sponsor golf air ah oh really yeah okay the race is not today but today is rehearsal day and what ow we are riding in the rehearsal flyover over the barin international circuit this is unbelievable so I guess this is a good sign that if you have a good idea ask if you don't ask it won't happen I guess at this point it feels normal you're just loading like you would if you had to take the staircase up uh holy cow that is big looks like golf air is celebrating their 70th anniversary and there are no other passengers coming along except for us this may seem unusual we have the entire 787 to ourself but I think we're not going to sit in business class I think we should sit in economy I want to sit behind the wing and I was told that we're going to be banking to the right so I want to make sure we're on the right hand side so we're looking down at the track so we have an entire Boeing 787 we were choosing not to sit in business class and we're not even sitting together I found a seat with the prime window position they don't always line up perfectly here we go pulling back oh it's taking me 20 minutes but I've just figured it out this video is about taking risks no not accepting offers from strangers over the internet but taking risks and betting on yourself see this banked Corner Trend Yep this this banked corner is nothing compared to what we're about to experience all right we're headed towards the circuit here's our first shot of the circuit and secure please remain secure that's it here we go so we are going to come straight down the main straight and then Bank hard right at 500 ft above the ground this wing tip should dip down giving us a great angle of the circuit off to the right this is going to be so cool you know how many times I've done this in my life zero zero times okay I'm just going to enjoy it enjoy it with us there's the track check looking good looking better set 500 ft yeah am going [Music] so to the bin International circuit golf air and everyone else that took a chance on me this week thank you Trent thanks for sticking with me too and to you watching whatever you want to achieve start now because one year can change a whole lot I don't know where I'm going next but I know I want you there with me I'll see you next week I am actually sweating like I do not I do not feel well I think if we had done another go I think I might have been sick","The transcript follows a narrative of a YouTuber who recounts an unexpected adventure initiated by an online invitation to Bahrain to attend a Formula 1 event.

ReDGjoFTn58,How the Abu Dhabi F1 Track was Built,"building an F1 track is no small feat but turning this a literal desert into this in just over 2 years time is nothing short of a construction Marvel the Yas Marina circuit in Abu Dhabi is believed to be the most expensive racing circuit in history with a reputed cost of over $1 billion the Emirates of Abu Dhabi felt that Formula 1 represented a good way of making the Middle East more more well known to the world and after the success of the Bahrain International circuit the idea for the Yas Marina circuit was born construction began in May 2007 and after 30 months of intensive planning and construction involving 14,000 workers and 35 million construction hours it hosted its Maiden race in November 2009 Sebastian vettle took the Victory and just one year later in ABI he would win his first ever F1 world championship a little over 10 years after that in 2021 the track entered the Formula 1 Hall of Fame with one of the most memorable and controversial endings in history the asarina circuit features five fully covered Grand stands a 227 birth Marina and the first hotel to have been built over a Formula 1 circuit sounds amazing right well the circuit was actually not very well received by both drivers and Spectators and so it underwent major changes to try and promote better racing a task which is much harder than it may seem but we'll come back to that later what makes this track build even more mind-blowing is the fact it's just one part of the mammoth Yaz Island a 25 Square km tourist attraction with a reported cost of $40 billion which holds nine hotels a Ferrari theme park a shopping mall a water park a golf course a beach a concert area a nightclub and currently the fastest roller coaster in the world but the question is how was it built and how did they do it in the middle of the desert before they could even begin thinking about the F1 track itself a lot of groundw work had to be carried out if you've seen any of the other Mega projects built in the United Arab Emirates such as the pan jumah in Dubai you'll know that a technique called sand dredging is needed to build these islands on water and despite yaas Island well being an island this wasn't necessary as the land already existed to separate it from Mainland Abu Dhabi they dug a 2m long Canal which the F1 track backs onto making its title of Yaz Marina circuit possible the island was developed by aldar properties who hired sabaro wct WL as the main contractor for the F1 circuit the 5.5 km long track was designed by Herman tilker a former race car driver who has designed many other racing tracks such as Circuit of the Americas Marina Bay and the Red Bull Ring impressively the build was completed in a little over 2 years which meant a constant construction schedule at times it was being built for 24 hours a day with a rotating worker schedule in that period they excavated 2 million cubic M of soil 200,000 cubic M of Steel was erected and they used 235,000 cubic M of concrete after 30 months of grueling work on October the 7th 2009 the FIA granted its final approval to hold a Formula 1 race Bruno Center was the first driver to complete a test run on the circuit it's undeniable what an incredible feat of construction both Yas Island and the Yas Marina circuit are but there may be some issues in the future the track is extremely flat but over time the track is becoming bumpier as the landfill is settling meaning at some point in the future it will require some major resurfacing speaking of which the surface is made from grey wac aggregate which is shipped to Abu Dhabi from a quarry in shopshire in England this same surface is used at the Bahrain International circuit it's popular amongst F1 drivers due to the high level of grip it offers but this does come at the expense of higher tire wear the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is unique due to the fact that it was the first ever Formula 1 race to start in daylight and end in dark because of this it needed a system that can provide enough light levels required for television broadcast and the safety standards issued by the international Racing Organization which includes things such as uniformity and glare control they commissioned mosow lighting to carry out this Mammoth task they've installed Lighting on other tracks such as the jeda circuit in 2021 which I will be making a video about before the next race in Saudi Arabia so make sure to Subs cribed for that one they implemented a 600 million Lumen lighting plan on 4,700 fixtures in less than 300 days after 15 years however the circuit needed a lighting upgrade they wanted a new system built for both safety and sustainability they opted for a total light control system which saves 30% more energy than the previous hid system the TLC system was installed on 4, 329 fixtures with 496 of those being color changing allowing them to put on light shows like this the lights are switched on Before the Race whilst it's still daytime so the lighting conditions on track remain consistent throughout for the drivers something else which lights up at the Yas Marina circuit is the uniquely designed W hotel which sits directly on top of the racetrack its futuristic shape is built from 2117 M curved glass and steel facade known as the gridshell this is covered in an LED lighting system that illuminates All 5,389 Glass elements individually the 499 room 85,000 Square M Hotel was built simultaneously with the racetrack and was opened on the 1st of November 2009 to coincide with the tracks Maiden F1 race however completing a project as impressive as the Yas Marina circuit only pays dividends if the actual racing is well received which unfortunately it wasn't in fact Kimmy reinan after the 2009 gr PRI said the first urns are quite good but the rest of it is it quickly developed a reputation for poor racing following its second F1 race the 2010 season finale where Fernando Alonzo saw his title hopes destroyed as he spent lap after lap stuck behind the slower Rena of vital Petrov the circuit simply didn't provide enough overtaking opportunities but making changes to a track isn't as simple as some people may think for starters so much consideration has to be made in terms of where to make the changes as most tracks have Parts with limited flexibility for example they weren't going to demolish the W Hotel you then have to make sure the surface material matches the original so the drivers don't feel a difference and you have to be pretty confident that the suggested changes would even make the racing better not worse and after all that time was the biggest challenge you we had a race to deliver in December and we had to go through an entire process of Designing the changes getting them approved getting them reviewed by the FIA making sure they meet all the standards of safety so after 12 years of racing at the asarina circuit it was finally time for a change they broke ground on July the 1st 2021 needing to be race ready for December their goal was simple open up sections of the track and create new overtaking opportunities to do this They carried out restructuring in three key areas at the North Hairpin they eliminated the chicane and made it wider at the South Marina section they eliminated four sharp corners for one banked corner corner and around the hotel they opened up the corner radius allowing for a faster flowing circuit these Works brought the track length down slightly to 5.28 km so the big question is did it work well the quick and easy answer is yes it did improve racing but nobody will remember the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in 2021 as its first year of a new track layout as it will forever be known as the year Max for stappen became world champion on the last lap all the year leis Hamilton was robbed of his eighth World Championship depending where you sit on that one anyway if you enjoyed this video I've made track build videos about both Monaco and the Las Vegas grand pris which you can find in the playlist on screen now","The transcript discusses the construction and modifications of the Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi, emphasizing its transformation from desert to a high-profile Formula 1 racing circuit. Opened in 2009, the circuit is described as a remarkable construction feat and one of the most expensive in history, costing over $1 billion. Despite its initially controversial reception due to limited overtaking opportunities, the circuit is part of the extensive Yas Island development, which includes numerous tourist attractions. The island's development employed cutting-edge techniques and faced challenges such as the circuit's flatness leading to eventual track settling and resurfacing needs. The original lighting system was later upgraded for sustainability. Changes to the track in 2021 aimed at improving racing quality by adjusting several track sections, which positively impacted the racing experience. However, the 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was overshadowed by controversy regarding the race's outcome, specifically concerning drivers Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton.

the future i think one of the most important things is as we pass through this people understanding what it means to have this kind of treasure and how it feeds into sustainability a lot of it is educating our people educating the public about the need for sustainability and how we need to be part of the ecosystem and not disturb it who has been the main leader in their sustainability part uh

traditional dao parled is going to talk me through the history of qatar and its relationship with the sea hey david hey how are you hi how are you thank you nice to meet you and we would like to take you in this traditional boat and little trip so possible but this is the best thing we can do [Music] how important is it to keep this as such a huge part of qatari culture we always have a touch and appreciation of the heritage that we have from the past this is always our identity yeah so we always we know where we came from and this is how he used to be in the past like even you can see the picture of the old dogs like we use it like in everywhere even in our locals and our money and there is some specific for bulk diving there is some specific for traveling for other culture it's very important to keep it because this is always our identity there is some people still use it for fishing but as you can see all the dolls all around you have been made in a way that for a pleasure purpose but what i love about them as well they're all unique there's not i haven't seen one copyright dao that's like the same it's the other one everyone is unique everyone is different that's what i love about it especially very special people in qatar are very proud of their culture huh very much one of those those they could buy a yacht okay but they prefer to have this choice it's like a you know something like attached to the people there tell me about the dell festival because i know it's it's huge so this is like an annual event that's happened and a lot of the dolls owners take their dolls over there they do some uh competition at that time like fishing competition and film really oyster oyster competitions so this is keep you know the culture especially when the families are there and the children they start to understand and learn about the culture and the history it's kind of education you know for the communities so when you look at the skyline you know for me it says the kind of progress a country has made in such a short space of time with keeping the history and heritage and what really matters to qatari people [Music] [Music] in qatar the modern and the traditional really do fuse to create something really special we've been on speed boats we've been on dowels and i got to ride a motorbike which was one of the highlights of my trip and also meeting
