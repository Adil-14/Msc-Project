    "After training my DistilBERT sentiment classifier for three epochs, the model achieved its best performance in the second epoch, with a final accuracy of 79.49% and a macro F1 score of 0.7609. The classification report shows that the model performed best on negative comments, achieving an F1 score of 0.86 with strong precision (0.83) and recall (0.89). Neutral sentiment was harder to classify, with a lower F1 score of 0.68 due to a drop in recall (0.64). Positive comments had a moderate F1 score of 0.75. Overall, the macro average F1 score of 0.76 indicates balanced performance across all classes, despite some class imbalance—most comments were negative, followed by neutral, and far fewer were positive. This aligns with expectations for a sensitive topic like Saudi Arabia hosting the 2034 World Cup.\n"
