    "- In this notebook, I rewrote all the thesis-relevant YouTube comments one by one using the OpenAI API (GPT-4o Mini), without using batch processing.  \n",
    "- I loaded the original dataset and removed any extra columns I didn’t need.  \n",
    "- The prompt was designed to clean up each comment — fixing grammar, spelling, and clarifying slang — while keeping the original meaning, tone, and even any explicit language.  \n",
    "- Before rewriting, the script checked which comments had already been processed so it wouldn’t redo anything.  \n",
    "- Each comment was sent individually to GPT-4o Mini, and the rewritten version was saved to a new CSV alongside the original info.  \n",
    "- This continued until all comments were done, and the final output was saved to `Rewritten_YouTube_Comments.csv`, ready to use for the next steps in the project.\n"
